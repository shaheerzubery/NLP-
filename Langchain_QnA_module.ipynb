Because of your success using the Guide Study Guide book in passing the PMP exam, we are able to continue to upgrade and refresh the with tips and hints from readers and with the changes made by PMI. Thank you also to all of the instructors and PMI chapters who use this book in their classes.\\n\\nAs always, a very special thank you to Neil Edde, Associate Publisher, for taking a chance on the\\n\\nfirst edition of this book and for giving me the opportunity to write it. Thank you again for the opportunity to revise and update it.\\n\\nThis book clearly fits the definition of a project and the team at Sybex is the best project team on earth to work with. I appreciate all the hard work and dedication everyone on the team put into producing this book. First, a special thanks to Jeff Kellum, Acquisitions Editor, for over- seeing this project and for his many suggestions that helped improve and strengthen the text. Thank you also, for keeping everyone focused on the quick turn around time even though we faced some uncertainties in the midst of the project.\\n\\nThank you to Elizabeth Campbell for all her help managing the many, many activities that must be coordinated in order to finish on schedule. She was very helpful throughout the process and didn’t scream when we found out close to the end of the project that some changes were needed to match up with newly published PMI materials.\\n\\nThanks to Judy Flynn, copyeditor, who did an outstanding job of helping me with all my gram- matical blunders. (She’ll probably even find some in this sentence!) She’s the best copyeditor I’ve ever worked with. I appreciate her eye for detail and that she never told me “doh” after her suggestions. Thanks also to all the behind the scenes team members including proofreader Nancy Riddi-\\n\\nough, and the compositors at Happenstance Type-o-rama!\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nI again had the pleasure of working with Claudia Baca who served as the technical editor for this that I edition. Claudia was invaluable when helping me decipher areas of questioned or weren’t clear to me. Thank you, Claudia, for your help, suggestions, and contribution. None of this would have been possible without the continued support and encouragement from my best friend in the whole world, BB. I love you and there’s no one else I’d rather spend the rest of my life with. Thank you to Bob and Terri, our best friends in all the earth, for your support and prayers—they’re always coveted. Thanks to my sister Jill and hubby John and to Sam, Prom- ise, and Destiny for their cheerleading behind the scenes. Thank you mom and dad for giving me the love of reading; some of my best memories are story time. And thanks also to the greatest chil- dren on the planet: Jason and Leah (our soon to be daughter-in-law), Noelle, and Amanda. And I can’t forget the two best grandchildren anywhere in the universe, Kate and Juliette. Thank you for your understanding of my limited availability and for your encouragement and support.\\n\\n3601FM.fm  Page viii  Monday, July 18, 2005  1:20 PM\\n\\nContents at a

 Page xvii  Thursday, July 14, 2005  5:50 PM\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThis book was designed for anyone thinking of taking the Project Management Professional (PMP) exam sponsored by the Project Management Institute (PMI). This certification is grow- ing in popularity and demand in all areas of business. PMI has experienced explosive growth in membership over the last few years, and more and more organizations are recognizing the importance of project management certification.\\n\\nWhile this book is written primarily for those of you taking the PMP exam, you can also use this book to study for the Certified Associate in Project Manage- ment (CAPM) exam. The exams are similar in style and the information covered in this book will help you with either exam.\\n\\nThis book has been updated to reflect the latest edition of\\n\\nA Guide to the Project Manage- It assumed you have knowledge of\\n\\nment Body of Knowledge, (PMBOK Guide) Third Edition. general project management practices, although not necessarily specific to It’s written so that you can skim through areas you are already familiar with, picking PMBOK. terminology where needed to pass the exam. You’ll find up the specific that the project management processes and techniques discussed in this book are defined in such A Guide a way that you’ll recognize things you’ve always done and be able to identify them with to the PMBOK\\n\\nprocess names or methodologies.\\n\\nGuide to the PMBOK\\n\\nA Guide to the\\n\\nPMI offers the most recognized certification in the field of project management, and this book deals exclusively with its procedures and methods. There are many methods of project management, each with its own terminology, tools, and procedures. If you’re familiar with another organized project management methodology, don’t assume you already know the Guide to the PMBOK processes. I strongly recommend that you learn all of the processes—their key inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. Take the time to memorize the key terms found at the end of every chapter as well. Sometimes just understanding the definition of a term will help you answer a question. It might be that you’ve always done that particular thing or used the methodology described but called it by another name. Know the name of each process and its primary purpose.\\n\\nWhat Is the PMP Certification?\\n\\nPMI is the leader and the most widely recognized organization in terms of promoting project management best practices. PMI strives to maintain and endorse standards and ethics in this field and offers publications, training, seminars, chapters, special interest groups, and colleges to further the project management discipline.\\n\\nPMI was founded in 1969 and first started offering the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification exam in 1984. PMI is accredited as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards developer and also has the distinction of being the first organization to have its certifica- tion program attain International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 recognition.\\n\\n3601.book  Page xviii  Thursday, July 14, 2005  5:50 PM\\n\\nxviii\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nPMI boasts a worldwide membership of over 150,000, with members from 150 different coun- tries. Local PMI chapters meet regularly and allow project managers to exchange information and learn about new tools and techniques of project management or new ways to use established tech- niques. I encourage you to join a local chapter and get to know other professionals in your field.\\n\\nWhy Become PMP Certified?\\n\\nThe following benefits are associated with becoming PMP certified:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIt demonstrates proof of professional achievement.\\n\\nIt increases your marketability.\\n\\nIt provides greater opportunity for advancement in your field.\\n\\nIt raises customer confidence in you and in your company’s services.\\n\\nDemonstrates Proof of Professional Achievement\\n\\nPMP certification is a rigorous process that documents your achievements in the field of project management. The exam tests your knowledge of the disciplined approaches, methodologies, and project management practices as described in\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK.\\n\\nYou are required to have several years of experience in project management before sitting for\\n\\nthe exam, as well as 35 hours of formal project management education. Your certification assures employers and customers that you are well grounded in project management practices and disciplines. It shows that you’ve got the hands-on experience and a mastery of the processes and disciplines to manage projects effectively and motivate teams to produce successful results.\\n\\nIncreases Your Marketability\\n\\nMany industries are realizing the importance of project management and its role in the organi- zation. They are also seeing that simply proclaiming a head technician to be a “project man- ager” does not make it so. Project management, just like engineering, information technology, and a host of other trades, has its own specific qualifications and skills. Certification tells poten- tial employers you’ve got the skills, experience, and knowledge to drive successful projects and ultimately improve the company’s bottom line.\\n\\nA certification will always make you stand out above the competition. If you’re certified and you’re competing against a project manager without certification, chances are you’ll come out as the top pick. As a hiring manager, all other things being equal, I will usually opt for the can- didate who has certification over the candidate who doesn’t have it. Certification tells potential employers you have gone the extra mile. You’ve spent time studying techniques and methods as well as employing them in practice. It shows dedication to your own professional growth and enhancement and to adhering to and advancing professional standards.\\n\\nProvides Opportunity for Advancement\\n\\nPMP certification displays your willingness to pursue growth in your professional career and shows that you’re not afraid of a little hard work to get what you want. Potential employers will\\n\\n3601.book  Page xix  Thursday, July 14, 2005  5:50 PM\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nxix\\n\\ninterpret your pursuit of this certification as a high-energy, success-driven, can-do attitude on your part. They’ll see that you’re likely to display these same characteristics on the job, which will help make the company successful. Your certification displays a success-oriented, moti- vated attitude that will open up opportunities for future career advancements in your current field as well as in new areas you might want to explore.\\n\\nRaises Customer Confidence\\n\\nJust as the PMP certification assures employers that you’ve got the background and experience to handle project management, it assures customers that they have a competent, experienced project manager at the helm. Certification will help your organization sell customers on your ability to manage their projects. Customers, like potential employers, want the reassurance that those working for them have the knowledge and skills necessary to carry out the duties of the position and that professionalism and personal integrity are of utmost importance. Individuals who hold these ideals will translate their ethics and professionalism to their work. This enhances the trust customers will have in you, which in turn will give you the ability to influence them on important project issues.\\n\\nHow to Become PMP Certified\\n\\nThere are several requirements you need to fulfill in order to sit for the PMP exam. PMI has and click detailed the certification process quite extensively at its website. Go to the Professional Development and Careers tab to reveal the Certifications selection and get the latest information on certification procedures and requirements.\\n\\nwww.pmi.org\\n\\nAs of the date this book was published, you are required to fill out an application to sit for the PMP exam. You can submit this application online at PMI’s website. You also need to doc- ument 35 hours of formal project management education. This might include college classes, seminars, workshops, and training sessions. Be prepared to list the class titles, location, date, and content.\\n\\nIn addition to filling out the application and documenting your formal project management training, there is one additional set of criteria you’ll need to meet to sit for the exam. These cri- teria fall into two categories. You need to meet the requirements for only one of these categories:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nCategory 1 is for those who hold a baccalaureate degree. You’ll need to provide proof, via transcripts, of your degree with your application. In addition, you’ll need to complete ver- ification forms—found at the PMI website—that show 4,500 hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of three years and no more than six years.\\n\\nCategory 2 is for those who do not hold a baccalaureate degree but do hold a high school diploma or equivalent. You’ll need to complete verification forms documenting 7,500 hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of five years and no more than eight years.\\n\\nThe exam fee at the time this book is being published is $405 for PMI members in good standing and $555 for non-PMI members. Testing is conducted at Thomson Prometric centers. You can find a center near you at the PMI website. You have six months from the time PMI\\n\\n3601.book  Page xx  Thursday, July 14, 2005  5:50 PM\\n\\nxx\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nreceives and approves your completed application to take the exam. You’ll need to bring a form of identification such as a driver’s license with you to the Thomson Prometric center on the test day. You will not be allowed to take anything with you into the testing center. You will be given a calculator, pencils, and scrap paper. You will turn in all scrap paper, including the notes and squiggles you’ve jotted during the test, to the center upon completion of the exam.\\n\\nThe exam is scored immediately, so you will know if you’ve passed at the conclusion of the test. You’re given four hours to complete the exam, which consists of 200 randomly generated questions. Only 175 of the 200 questions are scored. A passing score requires you answer 141 of the 175 questions correctly. 25 of the 200 questions are “pretest” questions that will appear randomly throughout the exam. These 25 questions are used by PMI to determine statistical information and to determine if they can or should be used on future exams. The questions on the exam cover the following process groups and areas:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nClosing\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\nAll unanswered questions are scored as wrong answers, so it benefits you to guess at an\\n\\nanswer if you’re stumped on a question.\\n\\nAfter you’ve received your certification, you’ll be required to earn 60 professional develop- ment units (PDUs) every three years to maintain certification. Approximately one hour of struc- tured learning translates to one PDU. The PMI website details what activities constitute a PDU, how many PDUs each activity earns, and how to register your PDUs with PMI to maintain your certification. As an example, attendance at a local chapter meeting earns one PDU.\\n\\nHow to Become CAPM Certified\\n\\nIf you find you don’t have quite enough experience or education to sit for the PMP exam, you should consider sitting for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam. The CAPM exam is structured like the PMP exam only the requirements are not as strict as they are for the PMP. CAPM candidates typically work in a supporting role with a project manager or as a subproject manager. Like the PMP, CAPM has two categories of requirements; each category requires 23 hours of project management education.\\n\\nCategory 1 is for those who hold a baccalaureate degree. You’ll need to provide proof, via tran- scripts, of your degree with your application. In addition, you’ll need to complete verification forms that show 1,500 hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of two years and no more than three years.\\n\\n3601.book  Page xxi  Thursday, July 14, 2005  5:50 PM\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nxxi\\n\\nCategory 2 is for those who do not hold a baccalaureate degree but do hold a high school diploma or equivalent. You’ll need to complete verification forms documenting 2,500 hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of two years and no more than three years.\\n\\nThe CAPM exam fee at the time of this publication is $225 for PMI members in good standing and $300 for non-PMI members.\\n\\nIncluded on the CD with this book is a sample CAPM exam. If you’re sitting for the CAPM exam, I encourage you to answer all of the end-of-chapter questions and take the Bonus Exams in addition to the sample CAPM exam. You’ll get a much broader sense of the types of questions and the topics you’ll encounter on the actual exam by using all of the sample questions pro- vided in this book and on the CD.\\n\\nWho Should Buy This Book?\\n\\nIf you are serious about passing the PMP exam (or the CAPM exam for that matter), you should buy this book and use it to study for the exam. This book is unique in that it walks you through the project processes from beginning to end, just as projects are performed in practice. When processes and you read this book, you will benefit by learning specific techniques coupled with real-life scenarios that describe how project managers in different sit- uations handle problems and the various issues all project managers are bound to encounter during their career. This Study Guide describes in detail the exam objective topics in each chap- ter and has attempted to cover all of the important project management concepts.\\n\\nGuide to the PMBOK\\n\\nHow to Use This Book and CD\\n\\nWe’ve included several testing features, both in the book and on the companion CD. Following this introduction is an Assessment Test that you can use to check your readiness for the actual exam. Take this test before you start reading the book. It will help you identify the areas you may need to brush up on. The answers to the Assessment Test appear after the last question of the test. Each answer includes an explanation and a note telling you in which chapter this material appears.\\n\\nAn Exam Essentials section appears at the end of every chapter to highlight the topics you’ll most likely find on the exam and help you focus on the most important material covered in the chapter so that you’ll have a solid understanding of those concepts. However, it isn’t possible to predict what questions will be covered on your particular exam, so be sure to study everything in the chapter.\\n\\nLike the exam itself, this Study Guide is organized in terms of process groups and the natural sequence of events a project goes through in its life cycle. By contrast, in other study guides, material is organized by knowledge area— Human Resource Management, Communications Management, and so on— and it can be confusing when studying for the exam to map the processes in each knowledge area to process groups.\\n\\n3601.book  Page xxii  Thursday, July 14, 2005  5:50 PM\\n\\nxxii\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nReview Questions are also provided at the end of every chapter. You can use these to gauge your understanding of the subject matter before reading the chapter and to point out the areas in which you need to concentrate your study time. As you finish each chapter, answer the Review Questions and then check to see if your answers are right—the correct answers appear on the pages following the last question. You can go back to reread the section that deals with each question you got wrong to ensure that you answer the question correctly the next time you are tested on the material. If you can answer at least 80 percent of the Review Questions cor- rectly, you can probably feel comfortable moving on to the next chapter. If you can’t answer that many correctly, reread the chapter, or the section that seems to be giving you trouble, and try the questions again. You’ll also find 200+ flashcard questions on the CD for on-the-go review. Download them right onto your Palm PocketPC device for quick and convenient reviewing.\\n\\nDon’t rely on studying the Review Questions exclusively as your study method. The questions you’ll see on the exam will be different than the questions pre- sented in the book. There are 200 randomly generated questions on the PMP exam and 150 on the CAPM, so it isn’t possible to cover every potential exam question in the Review Questions section of each chapter. Make sure you understand the concepts behind the material presented in each chapter and memorize all the formulas as well.\\n\\nIn addition to the Assessment Test and the Review Questions, you’ll find Bonus Exams on the CD. Take these practice exams just as if you were actually taking the exam (i.e., without any reference material). When you have finished the first exam, move on to the next exam to solidify your test-taking skills. If you get more than 85 percent of the answers correct, you’re ready to take the real exam.\\n\\nIf you purchased the Standard Edition of this book, there are a total of two bonus PMP exams and two additional CAPM exams. If you purchased the Deluxe Edition, there are a total of eight bonus PMP exams and two additional CAPM exams.\\n\\nFinally, you will notice various Real World Scenario sidebars throughout each chapter. These are designed to give you insight into how the various processes and topic areas apply to real-world situations.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are going to travel but still need to study for the PMP exam and you have a laptop with a CD drive, you can take this entire book with you just by taking the CD. This book is in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format, so it can be easily read on any computer.\\n\\nFor those of you who purchased the Deluxe Edition, you’ll find a series of scenarios and exer- cises that map to each chapter. These workbook exercises are designed to help you put the the- ories you’ve learned in each chapter into practice.\\n\\n3601.book  Page xxiii  Thursday, July 14, 2005  5:50 PM\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nxxiii\\n\\nThe Exam Objectives\\n\\nBehind every certification exam, you can be sure to find exam objectives—the broad topics in which the exam developers want to ensure your competency. The official PMP exam objectives are listed in this section.\\n\\nExam objectives are subject to change at any time without prior notice and at PMI’s sole discretion.

As soon as you get to your place, write down all the formulas and any other memory aids you used while study- ing before starting the exam. That way, you can relax a little because you won’t have to remember the formulas when you get to those questions on the exam—you can simply look at your scratch paper.\\n\\nVisit the PMI website at to find a testing site near you.\\n\\nwww.pmi.org\\n\\nfor the latest information regarding certification and\\n\\n3601.book  Page xxvi  Thursday, July 14, 2005  5:50 PM\\n\\nxxvi\\n\\nAssessment Test\\n\\nAssessment Test\\n\\n1.\\n\\nWhat is one of the most important skills a project manager can have?\\n\\nA.\\n\\nB.\\n\\nNegotiation skills\\n\\nInfluencing skills\\n\\nC.

The project sponsor has approached you with a dilemma. The CEO announced at the annual stockholders meeting that the project you’re managing will be completed by the end of this year. The problem is that this is six months prior to the scheduled completion date. It’s too late to go back and correct her mistake, and stockholders are expecting implementation by the announced date. You must speed up the delivery date of this project. Your primary constraint before this occurred was the budget. What actions can you take to help speed up the project?\\n\\nA.

We’ll address project and project management definitions as well as organizational structures. Good luck!\\n\\nIs It a Project?\\n\\nConsider the following scenario: The VP of marketing approaches you with a fabulous idea— ”fabulous” because he’s the big boss and because he thought it up. He wants to set up kiosks in local grocery stores as mini offices. These offices will offer customers the ability to sign up for new wireless phone services, make their wireless phone bill payments, and purchase equipment and accessories. He believes that the exposure in grocery stores will increase awareness of the company’s offerings. After all, everyone has to eat, right? He told you that the board of directors has already cleared the project and he’ll dedicate as many resources to this as he can. He wants the new kiosks in place in 12 stores by the end of next year. The best news is he’s assigned you to head up this project.\\n\\nYour first question should be, “Is it a project?” This may seem elementary, but confusing projects with ongoing operations happens often. Projects are temporary in nature, have definite start and end dates, result in the creation of a unique product or service, and are completed when their goals and objectives have been met and signed off by the stakeholders.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 3  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIs It a Project?\\n\\n3\\n\\nWhen considering whether or not you have a project on your hands, there are some things to keep in mind. First, is it a project or an ongoing operation? Next, if it is a project, who are the stakeholders? And third, what characteristics distinguish this endeavor as a project. We’ll look at each of these next.\\n\\nProjects versus Operations\\n\\nare temporary in nature and have definitive start dates and definitive end dates. The Projects project is completed when its goals and objectives are accomplished. Sometimes projects end when it’s determined that the goals and objectives cannot be accomplished or when the product or service of the project is no longer needed and the project is canceled. Projects exist to bring about a product or service that hasn’t existed before. This may include tangible products, ser- vices such as consulting or project management, and business functions that support the orga- nization. Projects may also produce a result or an outcome, such as a document that details findings of a research study. In this sense, a project is unique. However, don’t get confused by For example, Ford Motor Company is in the business of designing and assem- the term bling cars. Each model that Ford designs and produces can be considered a project. The models differ from each other in their features and are marketed to people with various needs. An SUV serves a different purpose and clientele than a luxury model. The design and marketing of these two models are unique projects. However, the actual assembly of the cars is considered an oper- ation—a repetitive process that is followed for most makes and models.\\n\\nunique.\\n\\nterms\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nDetermining the characteristics and features of the different car models is carried out through This means the characteristics of progressive elaboration. what the product or service of the project (the SUV, for example) are determined incrementally and are continually refined and worked out in detail as the project progresses. This concept goes along with the temporary and unique aspects of a project because when you first start the project, you don’t know all the minute details of the end product. Product characteristics typ- ically start out broad based at the beginning of the project and are progressively elaborated into more and more detail over time until they are complete and finalized. Keep in mind that product characteristics are progressively elaborated but the work of the project itself stays constant.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nProgressive elaboration is a concept you may encounter on the exam. Know this concept as it’s described in\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nare ongoing and repetitive. They involve work that is continuous without an ending date and you often repeat the same processes and produce the same results. The pur- pose of operations is to keep the organization functioning while the purpose of a project is to meet its goals and to conclude. Therefore, operations are ongoing while projects are unique and temporary.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 4  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n4\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1)\\n\\nWhat Is a Project?\\n\\nStakeholders\\n\\nA project is successful when it achieves its objectives and meets or exceeds the expectations of are those folks (or organizations) with a vested interest in your the stakeholders. project. They are the people who are actively involved with the work of the project or have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project.\\n\\nStakeholders\\n\\nKey stakeholders can make or break the success of a project. Even if all the deliverables are met and the objectives are satisfied, if your key stakeholders aren’t happy, nobody’s happy.\\n\\nThe\\n\\nproject sponsor,\\n\\ngenerally an executive in the organization with the authority to assign resources and enforce decisions regarding the project, is a stakeholder. The customer is a stake- holder, as are contractors and suppliers. The project manager, project team members, and the managers from other departments in the organization are stakeholders as well. It’s important to identify all the stakeholders in your project up front. If you leave out an important stakeholder or their department’s function and don’t discover the error until well into the project, it could be a project killer.\\n\\nFigure 1.1 shows a sample listing of the kinds of stakeholders involved on a typical project.\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 . 1\\n\\nProject stakeholders\\n\\nProject\\n\\nProject Manager\\n\\nProject\\n\\nSponsor\\n\\nDepartment\\n\\nManagers\\n\\nCustomer\\n\\nVendors\\n\\nBoard of\\n\\nDirectors\\n\\nSuppliers\\n\\nExecutive\\n\\nManagers\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nOffice\\n\\nStakeholders\\n\\nProject Manager\\n\\nProject Sponsor\\n\\nCustomer\\n\\nBoard of Directors\\n\\nExecutive Managers\\n\\nDepartment Managers\\n\\nVendors\\n\\nSuppliers\\n\\nProject Management Office\\n\\n3601.book  Page 5  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIs It a Project?\\n\\n5\\n\\nMany times, stakeholders have conflicting interests. It’s the project manager’s responsibility to understand these conflicts and try to resolve them. It’s also the project manager’s responsi- bility to manage stakeholder expectations. Be certain to identify and meet with all key stake- holders early in the project to understand all their needs and constraints. And when in doubt, stakeholder conflicts should always be resolved in favor of the customer.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about stakeholders and their needs in Chapter 3, “Developing the Project Scope Statement.”\\n\\nProject Characteristics\\n\\nWe’ve just learned that a project has several characteristics:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nProjects are unique.\\n\\nProjects are temporary in nature and have a definite beginning and ending date.\\n\\nProjects are completed when the project goals are achieved or it’s determined the project is no longer viable.\\n\\nA successful project is one that meets or exceeds the expectations of your stakeholders.\\n\\nUsing these criteria, let’s examine the assignment from the VP of marketing to determine if\\n\\nit is a project:\\n\\nIs it unique?

What now? The notes you scratched out on the back of a napkin at coffee break might get you started, but that’s not exactly good project management practice.\\n\\nWe have all witnessed this scenario—an assignment is made and the project team members jump directly into the project, busying themselves with building the product or service requested. Often, careful thought is not given to the project-planning process. I’m sure you’ve heard co- workers toss around statements like “That would be a waste of valuable time” or “Why plan when you can just start building?” Project progress is rarely measured against the customer requirements. In the end, the delivered product or service doesn’t meet the expectations of the cus- tomer! This is a frustrating experience for all those involved. Unfortunately, many projects follow this poorly constructed path. Project management\\n\\nbrings together a set of tools and techniques—performed by people— are the peo- to describe, organize, and monitor the work of project activities. ple responsible for managing the project processes and applying the tools and techniques used to carry out the project activities. All projects are composed of processes, even if they employ a haphazard approach. There are many advantages to organizing projects and teams around the project management processes endorsed by PMI. We’ll be examining those processes and their advantages in depth throughout the remainder of this book.\\n\\nProject managers\\n\\nProject management involves applying knowledge, skills, and techniques during the course of the project to accomplish the project requirements. It is the responsibility of the project man- ager to ensure that project management techniques are applied and followed.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nKnow the term\\n\\nproject management\\n\\nas it’s described in\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK.\\n\\nProject management is a process that includes planning, putting the project plan into action,\\n\\nand measuring progress and performance. It involves identifying the project requirements, establishing project objectives, balancing constraints, and taking the needs and expectations of the key stakeholders into consideration. Planning is one of the most important functions you’ll perform during the course of a project. It sets the standard for the rest of the project’s life and is used to track future project performance. Before we begin the planning process, let’s look at some of the ways the work of project management is organized.\\n\\nPrograms\\n\\nPrograms are groups of related projects that are managed using the same techniques in a coor- dinated fashion. When projects are managed collectively as programs, they capitalize on bene- fits that wouldn’t be achievable if the projects were managed separately. This would be the case\\n\\n3601.book  Page 7  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nWhat Is Project Management?\\n\\n7\\n\\nwhere a very large program exists with many subprojects under it—for example, building a new shopping mall. Many subprojects exist underneath this program, such as excavation, construc- tion, interior design, store placement, marketing, facilities management, and so on. Each of the subprojects is really a project unto itself. Each subproject has its own project manager, who reports to a project manager with responsibility over several of the areas, who in turn reports to the head project manager over the entire program. All of the projects are related and are man- aged together so that collective benefits are realized and controls are implemented and managed in a coordinated fashion. Sometimes programs involve aspects of ongoing operations as well. After the shopping mall in our example is built, the management of the facility becomes the ongoing operations part of this program. The management of this collection of projects is called program management. groups of related projects to meet the objectives of the program.\\n\\ninvolves centrally managing and coordinating\\n\\nProgram management\\n\\nPortfolios\\n\\nare collections of programs and projects that meet a specific business goal or objective. Portfolios Let’s say our company is in the construction business. There are several business units within our organization: retail, single family residential, and multifamily residential. All projects and pro- grams associated with the retail business unit belong to the retail portfolio. The program we talked about in the preceding section (the collection of projects associated with building the new shopping mall) is one of the programs that belongs to the retail portfolio. There could be other programs and projects within this portfolio as well. The objective of any program or project in this portfolio is to meet the strategic objectives of the portfolio, which in turn should meet the objec- encompasses man- tives of the department and ultimately the corporation. aging the collections of programs and projects in the portfolio. This includes weighing the value of each project, or potential project, against the portfolio’s strategic objectives. It also concerns monitoring active projects for adherence to objectives, balancing the portfolio among the other investments of the organization, and assuring the efficient use of resources. Portfolio management is generally performed by a senior manager in the organization.\\n\\nPortfolio management\\n\\nProject Management Offices\\n\\nproject management office,\\n\\nsometimes referred to as the PMO, has been around The concept of a for several years. You’ll find that many organizations are establishing PMOs in many different forms. PMOs may also be called project offices or program management offices. The PMO is usu- ally a centralized organizational unit that oversees the management of projects and programs throughout the organization. The most common reason a company starts a project management office is to establish and maintain procedures and standards for project management methodol- ogies. In some organizations, project managers and team members might report directly to the PMO and are assigned to projects as they are initiated. In other organizations, the PMO only pro- vides support functions for projects and trains others in project management procedures and tech- niques. Still others, depending on their size and function, have experts available that assist project managers in project planning, estimating, and business assumption verification tasks. They serve as mentors to junior-level project managers and act as consultants to the senior project managers.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 8  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n8\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1)\\n\\nWhat Is a Project?\\n\\nA PMO can exist in all organizational structures, functional, matrix, or projec- tized. It may have full authority to oversee projects, including the authority to cancel projects, or it may serve only in an advisory role.\\n\\nThe PMO usually has responsibility for maintaining and archiving project documentation for future reference. This office compares project goals with project progress and gives feedback to the project teams. It also measures the project performance of active projects and suggests corrective actions. The PMO evaluates completed projects for their adherence to the project plan and asks questions like the following: Did the project meet the time frames established, did it stay within budget, and was the quality acceptable?\\n\\nProject management offices are becoming more common in organizations today, if for no other reason than to serve as a collection point for project documentation. Some PMOs are fairly sophisticated and prescribe the standards and methodologies to be used in all project phases across the enterprise. Still others provide all these functions and also offer project man- agement consulting services. However, the establishment of a PMO is not required in order for you to apply good project management practices to your next project.\\n\\nDefining Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs\\n\\nMany times, organizations will knight their technical experts as project managers. The skill and expertise that made them stars in their technical fields are mistakenly thought to translate into project management skills. This is not necessarily so.\\n\\nProject managers are generalists with many skills in their repertoire. They are also problem solv- ers who wear many hats. Project managers might indeed possess technical skills, but technical skills are not a prerequisite for sound project management skills. Your project team should include a few technical experts, and these are the people whom the project manager will rely on for technical details. Understanding and applying good project management techniques, along with a solid under- standing of general management skills, are career builders for all aspiring project managers.\\n\\nProject managers have been likened to small-business owners. They need to know a little bit about every aspect of management. General management skills include every area of manage- ment, from accounting to strategic planning, supervision, personnel administration, and more. General management skills are called into play on every project. But some projects require spe- cific skills in certain application areas. Application areas are made up of categories of projects that have common elements. These elements, or application areas, can be defined several ways: by industry group (automotive, pharmaceutical), by department (accounting, marketing), by technical (software development, engineering) or management (procurement, research and development) specialties. These application areas are usually concerned with disciplines, regu- lations, and the specific needs of the project, the customer, or the industry. For example, most\\n\\n3601.book  Page 9  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDefining Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs\\n\\n9\\n\\ngovernments have specific procurement rules that apply to their projects that wouldn’t be appli- cable in the construction industry. The pharmaceutical industry is acutely interested in regula- tions set forth by the Food and Drug Administration, whereas the automotive industry has little or no concern for either of these types of regulations. Having experience in the application area you’re working in will give you a leg up when it comes to project management. While you can call in the experts who have application area knowledge, it doesn’t hurt for you to understand the specific aspects of the application areas of your project.\\n\\nThe general management skills listed in this section are the foundation of good project manage- ment practices. Your mastery of them (or lack thereof) will likely affect project outcomes. The var- ious skills of a project manager can be broken out in a more or less declining scale of importance. We’ll look at an overview of these skills now and discuss each in more detail in subsequent chapters.\\n\\nCommunication Skills\\n\\nOne of the single most important characteristics of a first-rate project manager is excellent com- munication skills. Written and oral communications are the backbone of all successful projects. Many forms of communication will exist during the life of your project. As the creator or man- ager of most of the project communication (project documents, meeting updates, status reports, etc.), it’s your job to ensure that the information is explicit, clear, and complete so that your audience will have no trouble understanding what has been communicated. Once the informa- tion has been distributed, it is the responsibility of the person receiving the information to make sure they understand it.\\n\\nThere are many forms of communication and communication styles. I’ll dis- cuss them more in depth in Chapter 8, “Developing the Project Team.”\\n\\nOrganizational and Planning Skills\\n\\nOrganizational and planning skills are closely related and probably the most important, after communication skills, a project manager can possess. Organization takes on many forms. As project manager, you’ll have project documentation, requirements information, memos, project reports, personnel records, vendor quotes, contracts, and much more to track and be able to locate at a moment’s notice. You will also have to organize meetings, put together teams, and perhaps manage and organize media release schedules, depending on your project.\\n\\nTime management skills are closely related to organizational skills. It’s difficult to stay orga- nized without an understanding of how you’re managing your time. I recommend you attend a time management class if you’ve never taken one. They have some great tips and techniques to help you prioritize problems and interruptions, prioritize your day, and manage your time. Planning is discussed extensively throughout the course of this book. There isn’t any aspect of project management that doesn’t first involve planning. Planning skills go hand in hand with organizational skills. Combining these two with excellent communication skills is almost a sure guarantee of your success in the project management field.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 10  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n10\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1)\\n\\nWhat Is a Project?\\n\\nBudgeting Skills\\n\\nProject managers establish and manage budgets and therefore need some knowledge of finance and accounting principles. Especially important in this skill area is the ability to perform cost estimates for project budgeting. There are different methods available to determine the project costs. They range from estimating individual activities and rolling the estimates up to estimating the project’s cost in one big chunk. These methods will be discussed more fully in later chapters. After a budget is determined, you can start spending. This sounds more exciting than it actually is. Reading and understanding vendor quotes, preparing or overseeing purchase orders, and rec- onciling invoices are budgeting skills that will be used by the project manager on most projects. These costs will be linked back to project activities and expense items in the project’s budget.\\n\\nConflict Management Skills\\n\\nShow me a project, and I’ll show you problems. All projects have some problems, as does, in fact, much of everyday life. Isn’t that what they say builds character? But I digress.\\n\\nConflict management involves solving problems. Problem solving is really a twofold process. First, you must define the problem by separating the causes from the symptoms. Often when defining problems, you end up just describing the symptoms instead of really getting to the heart of what’s causing the problem. To avoid that, ask yourself questions like, “Is it an internal or external problem?” and “Is it a technical problem?” and “Are there interpersonal problems between team members?” and “Is it managerial?” and “What are the potential impacts or con- sequences?” These kinds of questions will help you to get to the cause of the problem.\\n\\nNext, after the problem has been defined, you have some decisions to make. It will take a lit- tle time to examine and analyze the problem, the situation causing it, and the alternatives avail- able. After this analysis, the project manager will determine the best course of action to take and implement the decision. The timing of the decision is often as important as the decision itself. If you make a good decision but implement it too late, it may turn into a bad decision.\\n\\nNegotiation and Influencing Skills\\n\\nEffective problem solving requires negotiation and influencing skills. We all utilize negotiation skills in one form or another every day. For example, on a nightly basis I am asked, “Honey, what do you want for dinner?” Then the negotiations begin, and the fried chicken versus swordfish dis- cussion commences. Simply put, negotiating is working with others to come to an agreement.\\n\\nNegotiation on projects is necessary in almost every area of the project, from scope definition to budgets, contracts, resource assignments, and more. This may involve one-on-one negotia- tion or it might involve teams of people, and it can occur many times throughout the project.

Leaders impart vision, gain consensus for Leaders strategic goals, establish direction, and inspire and motivate others. Managers focus on results and are concerned with getting the job done according to the requirements. Even though leaders and managers are not the same, project managers must exhibit the characteristics of both during dif- ferent times on the project. Understanding when to switch from leadership to management and then back again is a finely tuned and necessary talent.\\n\\nTeam\\n\\n\\n\\nBuilding and Motivating Skills\\n\\nProject managers will rely heavily on team-building and motivational skills. Teams are often formed with people from different parts of the organization. These people may or may not have worked together before, so there may be some component of team-building groundwork that will involve the project manager. The project manager will set the tone for the project team and will help them work through the various team-forming stages to become fully functional. Motivat- ing the team, especially during long projects or those experiencing a lot of bumps along the way, is another important role the project manager fulfills during the course of the project.\\n\\nAn interesting caveat to the team-building role is that project managers many times are responsible for motivating team members who are not their direct reports. This has its own set of challenges and dilemmas. One way to help this situation is to ask the functional manager to allow you to participate in your project team members’ performance reviews. Use the negotia- tion and influencing skills I talked about earlier to make sure you’re part of this process.\\n\\nA Mile Wide and an Inch Deep\\n\\nProject managers are an interesting bunch. They know a little bit about a lot of things and are excel- lent communicators. Or, as one person said, they’re “a mile wide and an inch deep.” They have the ability to motivate people, even those who have no reason to be loyal to the project, and they can make the hard-line calls when necessary. Project managers can get caught in sticky situations that occasionally require making decisions that are good for the company (or the customer) but aren’t good for certain stakeholders. These offended stakeholders will then drag their feet, and the project manager has to play the heavy in order to motivate and gain their cooperation again. Some orga- nizations hire contract project managers to run their large, company-altering projects, just because they don’t want to burn out a key employee in this role. Fortunately, that doesn’t happen often.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 12  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n12\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1)\\n\\nWhat Is a Project?\\n\\nNow that you’ve been properly introduced to some of the skills you need in your tool kit,\\n\\nyou’ll know to be prepared to communicate, solve problems, lead, and negotiate your way through your next project.\\n\\nUnderstanding Organizational Structures\\n\\nJust as projects are unique, so are the organizations in which they’re carried out. Organizations have their own styles and cultures that influence how project work is carried out. One of the keys to determining the type of organization you work in is measuring how much authority senior man- agement is willing to delegate to project managers. While uniqueness abounds in business cultures, all organizations are structured in one of three ways: functional, projectized, or matrix. Variations and combinations exist among these three structures, such as a projectized structure within a func- tional organization and weak matrix, balanced matrix, and strong matrix organizations.\\n\\nIt pays to know and understand the organizational structure and the culture of the entity you’re working with. Companies with aggressive cultures that are comfortable in a leading-edge position within their industry are highly likely to take on risky projects. Project managers who are willing to suggest new ideas and projects that have never been undertaken before are likely to receive a warm reception in this kind of environment. Conversely, organizational cultures that are risk averse and prefer the follow-the-leader position within their industry are highly unlikely to take on risky endeavors. Project managers with risk-seeking, aggressive styles are likely to receive a cool reception in a culture like this.\\n\\nThe level of authority the project manager enjoys is denoted by the organizational structure. For example, a project manager within a functional organization has little to no formal author- ity. And their title may not be project manager; instead they might be called a project leader, a project coordinator, or perhaps a project expeditor.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at each of these types of organizations individually to better understand\\n\\nhow the project management role works in each one.\\n\\nFunctional Organizations\\n\\nChances are you have worked One common type of organization is the in this type of organization. This is probably the oldest style of organization and is therefore known as the traditional approach to organizing businesses.\\n\\nfunctional organization.\\n\\nFunctional organizations are centered on specialties and grouped by function, hence the term As an example, the organization might have a human resources depart-\\n\\nfunctional organization. ment, finance department, marketing department, etc. The work in these departments is spe- cialized and requires people who have the skill sets and experiences in these specialized functions to perform specific duties for the department. Figure 1.2 shows a typical organiza- tional chart for a functional organization.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 13  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Organizational Structures\\n\\n13\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 . 2\\n\\nFunctional organizational chart\\n\\nCEO\\n\\nHuman\\n\\nResources\\n\\nFinance\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\nInformation\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nProduction\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nYou can see that this type of organization is set up to be a hierarchy. Staff personnel report to managers who report to department heads who report to vice presidents who report to the CEO. In other words, each employee reports to only one manager; ultimately, one person at the top is in charge. Many companies today, as well as governmental agencies, are structured in a hierarchical fashion. In organizations like this, be aware of the chain of command. A strict chain of command may exist, and the corporate culture might dictate that you follow it. Roughly translated: who talks to the big boss. mand, how strictly it’s enforced, and how the chain is linked before venturing outside of it.\\n\\nDon’t talk to the big boss without first talking to your boss who talks to their boss Wise project managers should determine if there is a chain of com-\\n\\nEach department or group in a functional organization is managed independently and has a\\n\\nlimited span of control. Marketing doesn’t run the finance department or their projects, for example. The marketing department is concerned with their own functions and projects. If it were necessary for the marketing department to get input from the finance department on a project, the marketing team members would follow the chain of command. A marketing man- ager would speak to a manager in finance to get the needed information and then pass it back down to the project team.\\n\\nHuman Resources in a Functional Organization\\n\\nCommonalities exist among the personnel assigned to the various departments in a functional organization. In theory, people with similar skills and experiences are easier to manage as a group. Instead of scattering them throughout the organization, it is more efficient to keep them functioning together. Work assignments are easily distributed to those who are best suited for the task when everyone with the same skill works together. Usually, the supervisors and man- agers of these workers are experienced in the area they supervise and are able to recommend training and career enrichment activities for their employees.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 14  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n14\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1)\\n\\nWhat Is a Project?\\n\\nWorkers in functional organizations specialize in an area of expertise—finance or personnel administration, for instance—and then become very good at their specialty.\\n\\nThere is a clear upward career path for people in a functional organization. An assistant bud- get analyst may be promoted to a budget analyst and then eventually to a department manager over many budget analysts.\\n\\nThe Downside of Functional Organizations\\n\\nFunctional organizations have their disadvantages. If this is the kind of organization you work in, you probably have experienced some of them.\\n\\nOne of the greatest disadvantages for the project manager is that they have little to no formal authority. This does not mean that project managers in functional organizations are doomed to failure. Many projects are undertaken and successfully completed within this type of organiza- tion. Good communication and interpersonal and influencing skills on the part of the project manager are required to bring about a successful project under this structure.\\n\\nIn a functional organization, the vice president or senior department manager is usually the one responsible for projects. The title of project manager denotes authority, and in a functional structure, that authority rests with the VP.\\n\\nManaging Projects in a Functional Organization\\n\\nProjects are typically undertaken in a divided approach in a functional organization. For exam- ple, the marketing department will work on their portion of the project and then hand it off to the manufacturing department to complete their part, and so on. The work the marketing department does is considered a marketing project, while the work the manufacturing depart- ment does is considered a manufacturing project.\\n\\nSome projects require project team members from different departments to work together at the same time on various aspects of the project. Project team members in this structure will more than likely remain loyal to their functional manager. The functional manager is responsible for their performance reviews, and their career opportunities lie within the functional department— not within the project team. Exhibiting leadership skills by forming a common vision regarding the project and the ability to motivate people to work toward that vision are great skills to exercise in this situation. As previously mentioned, it also doesn’t hurt to have the project manager work with the functional manager in contributing to the employee’s performance review.\\n\\nResource Pressures in a Functional Organization\\n\\nCompetition for resources and project priorities can become fierce when multiple projects are undertaken within a functional organization. For example, in my organization, it’s common to have competing project requests from three or more departments all vying for the same resources. Thrown into the heap is the requirement to make, for example, mandated tax law changes, which automatically usurps all other priorities. This sometimes causes frustration and\\n\\n3601.book  Page 15  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Organizational Structures\\n\\n15\\n\\npolitical infighting. One department thinks their project is more important than another and will do anything to get that project pushed ahead of the others. Again, it takes great skill and diplomatic abilities to keep projects on track and functioning smoothly. In a later chapter, we’ll discuss the importance of gaining stakeholder buy-in and of prioritization and communication distribution to avert some of these problems.\\n\\nProject managers have little authority in functional organizations, but with the right skills, they can successfully accomplish many projects.

The focus of this Projectized organizations type of organization is the project itself. The idea behind a projectized organization is to develop loyalty to the project, not to a functional manager.\\n\\nFigure 1.3 shows a typical org chart for a projectized organization.\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 . 3\\n\\nProjectized organizational chart\\n\\nCEO\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManager\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManager\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManager\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManager\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManager\\n\\nProject\\n\\nTeam\\n\\nMembers/\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nProject\\n\\nTeam\\n\\nMembers/\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nProject\\n\\nTeam\\n\\nMembers/\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nProject\\n\\nTeam\\n\\nMembers/\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nProject\\n\\nTeam\\n\\nMembers/\\n\\nStaff\\n\\n3601.book  Page 16  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n16\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nOrganizational resources are dedicated to projects and project work in purely projectized organi- zations. Project managers almost always have ultimate authority over the project in this structure and report directly to the CEO. In a purely projectized organization, supporting functions like human resources and accounting might report directly to the project manager as well. Project managers are responsible for making decisions regarding the project and acquiring and assigning resources. They have the authority to choose and assign resources from other areas in the organization or to hire them from outside if needed. For example, if there isn’t enough money in the budget to hire additional resources, the project manager will have to come up with alternatives to solve this problem. This is known as a constraint. Project managers in all organizational structures are limited by the triple con- straints commonly known as: project scope, schedule, and cost (or budget). Quality is sometimes considered a constraint and it’s generally affected by scope, schedule, and/or cost. We’ll talk more about constraints in Chapter 2, “Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement.”\\n\\nTeams are formed and often collocated, which means that team members physically work at the same location. Project team members report to the project manager, not to a functional or departmental manager. One obvious drawback to a projectized organization is that project team members may find themselves out of work at the end of the project. An example of this might be a consultant who works on a project until completion and then is put on the bench or let go at the end of the project. Some inefficiency exists in this kind of organization when it comes to resource utilization. If you have a situation where you need a highly specialized skill at certain times throughout the project, the resource you’re using to perform this function might be idle during other times in the project.\\n\\nIn summary, projectized organizations are identified in several ways:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nProject managers have ultimate authority over the project.\\n\\nThe focus of the organization is the project.\\n\\nThe organization’s resources are focused on projects and project work.\\n\\nTeam members are collocated.\\n\\nLoyalties are formed to the project, not to a functional manager.\\n\\nProject teams are dissolved at the conclusion of the project.\\n\\nMatrix Organizations\\n\\nMatrix organizations came about to minimize the differences between, and take advantage of, the strengths and weaknesses of functional and projectized organizations. The idea at play here is that the best of both organizational structures can be realized by combining them into one. The project objectives are fulfilled and good project management techniques are utilized while still maintaining a hierarchical structure in the organization.\\n\\nEmployees in a matrix organization report to one functional manager and to at least one project manager. It’s possible that employees could report to multiple project managers if they are working on multiple projects at one time. Functional managers pick up the administrative portion of the duties and assign employees to projects. They also monitor the work of their employees on the various projects. Project managers are responsible for executing the project and giving out work assignments based on project activities. Project managers and functional managers share the responsibility of performance reviews for the employee.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 17  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Organizational Structures\\n\\n17\\n\\nThe Projectized Graphic Artist\\n\\nYou’ve been appointed project manager for your company’s website design and implementa- tion. You’re working in a projectized organization, so you have the authority to acquire and assign resources. You put together your team, including programmers, technical writers, testers, and business analysts. Debbie, a highly qualified graphic arts designer, is also part of your team. Debbie’s specialized graphic arts skills are needed only at certain times throughout the project. When she has completed the graphic design portion of the screen she’s working on, there isn’t anything else for her to do until the next page is ready. Depending on how involved the project is and how the work is structured, days or weeks might pass before Deb- bie’s skills are needed. This is where the inefficiency occurs in a purely projectized organiza- tion. The project manager will have to find other duties that Debbie can perform during these down times. It’s not practical to let her go and then hire her back when she’s needed again.\\n\\nIn this situation, you might assign Debbie to other project duties when she’s not working on graphic design. Perhaps she can edit the text for the web pages or assist with the design of the upcoming marketing campaign. You might also share Debbie’s time with another project man- ager in the organization.\\n\\nDuring the planning process, you will discover the skills and abilities of all your team members so that you can plan their schedules accordingly and eliminate idle time.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, functional managers assign employees to projects, while project managers assign tasks associated with the project in a matrix organization.\\n\\nMatrix organizations have unique characteristics. We’ll look at how projects are conducted and managed and how project and functional managers share the work in this organizational structure next.\\n\\nProject Focus in a Matrix Organization\\n\\nMatrix organizations allow project managers to focus on the project and project work just as in a projectized organization. The project team is free to focus on the project objectives without distractions from the functional department.\\n\\nProject managers should take care when working up activity and project estimates for the project in a matrix organization. The estimates should be given to the functional managers for input before publishing. The functional manager is the one in charge of assigning or freeing up resources to work on projects. If the project manager is counting on a certain employee to work on the project at a certain time, the project manager should determine their availability up front with the functional manager. Project estimates might have to be modified if it’s discovered that the employee they were counting on is not available when needed.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 18  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n18\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nBalance of Power in a Matrix Organization\\n\\nAs we’ve discussed, a lot of communication and negotiation takes place between the project manager and the functional manager. This calls for a balance of power between the two or one will dominate the other.\\n\\nIn a strong matrix organization, the balance of power rests with the project manager. They have the ability to strong-arm the functional managers into giving up their best resources for projects. Sometimes, more resources than necessary are assembled for the project, and then project managers negotiate these resources among themselves, cutting out the functional man- ager altogether, as you can see in Figure 1.4.\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 . 4\\n\\nStrong matrix organizational chart\\n\\nCEO\\n\\nManager\\n\\nof Project\\n\\nManagers\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManager\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManager\\n\\nFinance\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\nInformation\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nProduction\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 . 5 Weak matrix organizational chart\\n\\nCEO\\n\\nHuman\\n\\nResources\\n\\nFinance\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\nInformation\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nProduction\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff/Project\\n\\nCoordinator\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\n3601.book  Page 19  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Organizational Structures\\n\\n19\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 . 6\\n\\nBalanced matrix organizational chart\\n\\nCEO\\n\\nHuman\\n\\nResources\\n\\nFinance\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\nInformation\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nProduction\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nProject\\n\\nManager\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the weak matrix (see Figure 1.5). As you would suspect, the functional managers have all the power in this structure. Project managers are really project coordinators or expeditors with part-time responsibilities on projects in a weak matrix organi- zation. Project managers have little to no authority, just as in the functional organization. On the other hand, the functional managers have a lot of authority and make all the work assign- ments. The project manager simply expedites the project.\\n\\nIn between the weak matrix and the strong matrix is an organizational structure called the balanced matrix (see Figure 1.6). The features of the balanced matrix are what we’ve been dis- cussing throughout this section. The power is balanced between project managers and func- tional managers. Each manager has responsibility for their parts of the project or organization, and employees get assigned to projects based on the needs of the project, not the strength or weakness of the manager’s position.\\n\\nMatrix organizations have subtle differences, and it’s important to understand their differ- ences for the PMP exam. The easiest way to remember them is that the weak matrix has many of the same characteristics as the functional organization, while the strong matrix has many of the same characteristics as the projectized organization. The balanced matrix is exactly that— a balance between weak and strong, where the project manager shares authority and responsi- bility with the functional manager. Table 1.2 compares all three structures.\\n\\nMost organizations today use some combination of the organizational structures described\\n\\nhere. They’re a composite of functional, projectized, and matrix structures. It’s rare that an organization would be purely functional or purely projectized. For example, projectized struc- tures can coexist within functional organizations.\\n\\nIn the case of a high-profile, critical project, the functional organization might appoint a spe- cial project team to work only on that project. The team is structured outside the bounds of the functional organization and the project manager has ultimate authority for the project. This is a workable project management approach and ensures open communication between the project manager and team members. At the end of the project, the project team is dissolved and the project members return to their functional areas to resume their usual duties.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 20  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n20\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 2\\n\\nComparing Matrix Structures\\n\\nWeak Matrix\\n\\nBalanced Matrix\\n\\nStrong Matrix\\n\\nProject Manager’s\\n\\nTitle:\\n\\nProject coordinator,\\n\\nproject leader, or\\n\\nproject expeditor\\n\\nProject manager\\n\\nProject manager\\n\\nProject Manager’s\\n\\nFocus:\\n\\nSplit focus between\\n\\nproject and functional\\n\\nresponsibilities\\n\\nProjects and\\n\\nproject work\\n\\nProjects and project\\n\\nwork\\n\\nProject Manager’s\\n\\nPower:\\n\\nMinimal authority\\n\\nand power\\n\\nBalance of authority\\n\\nand power\\n\\nFull authority and\\n\\npower\\n\\nProject Manager’s\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nOrganization Style:\\n\\nPart\\n\\n\\n\\ntime on projects\\n\\nFull\\n\\n\\n\\ntime on projects\\n\\nFull\\n\\n\\n\\ntime on\\n\\nprojects\\n\\nMost like functional\\n\\norganization\\n\\nBlend of both weak\\n\\nand strong matrix\\n\\nMost like a projec\\n\\n\\n\\ntized organization\\n\\nProject Manager\\n\\nReports to:\\n\\nFunctional manager\\n\\nA functional manager,\\n\\nbut shares authority\\n\\nand power\\n\\nManager of project\\n\\nmanagers\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nOrganizational structure is a topic you may encounter on the exam.

Understanding the organiza- tional structure will help you, as a project manager, with the cultural influences and communi- cation avenues that exist in the organization to gain cooperation and successfully bring your projects to a close.\\n\\nUnderstanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes\\n\\nProject life cycles are similar to the life cycle that parents experience raising their children to adulthood. Children start out as infants and generate lots of excitement wherever they go. How- ever, not much is known about them at first. So you study them as they grow and assess their\\n\\n3601.book  Page 21  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes\\n\\n21\\n\\nneeds. Over time, they mature and grow (and cost a lot of money in the process), until one day the parents’ job is done.\\n\\nProjects start out just like this and progress along a similar path. Someone comes up with a great idea for a project and actively solicits support for it. The project, after being approved, progresses through the intermediate phases to the ending phase, where it is completed and closed out.\\n\\nProject Phases and Project Life Cycles\\n\\nAll projects are divided into phases, and all projects, large or small, have a similar life cycle structure. At a minimum, a project will have a beginning or initiation phase, an intermediate phase or phases, and an ending phase. The number of phases depends on the project complexity and the industry. For example, information technology projects may progress through phases such as requirements, design, program, test, and implement. All the collective phases the project progresses through in concert are called the project life cycle.\\n\\nThe end of each phase allows the project manager, stakeholders, and project sponsor the opportunity to determine if the project should continue to the next phase. In order to progress to the next phase, the deliverable from the phase before it must be reviewed for accuracy and approved. As each phase is completed, it’s handed off to the next phase. We’ll look at handoffs and progressions through these phases next.\\n\\nHandoffs\\n\\nProject phases evolve through the life cycle in a series of phase sequences called handoffs, or technical transfers. The end of one phase sequence typically marks the beginning of the next. However, the completion of one phase does not automatically signal the beginning of the next phase. For example, in the construction industry, feasibility studies often take place in the begin- ning phase of a project.\\n\\nThe purpose of the feasibility study is to determine if the project is worth undertaking and whether the project will be profitable to the organization. A feasibility study is a preliminary assessment of the viability of the project, the viability or perhaps marketability of the product or service of the project, and the project’s value to the organization. It may also determine if the product or service of the project is safe and meets industry or governmental standards and reg- ulations. The completion and approval of the feasibility study triggers the beginning of the requirements phase, where requirements are documented and then handed off to the design phase, where blueprints are produced. The feasibility may also show that the project is not worth pursuing and the project is terminated; thus, the next phase never begins.\\n\\nPhase Completion\\n\\nYou will recognize phase completion because each phase has a specific deliverable, or multiple deliverables, that marks the end of the phase. A deliverable is an output that must be produced, reviewed, and approved to bring the phase or project to completion. Deliverables are tangible and can be measured and easily proved. For instance, a hypothetical deliverable produced in the begin- ning phase of our construction industry example would be the feasibility study. Deliverables might also include things like design documents, project budgets, blueprints, project schedules,\\n\\n3601.book  Page 22  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n22\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nprototypes, etc. This analysis allows those involved with the opportunity to determine if the project should continue to the next phase. The feasibility study might show that environmental impacts of an enormous nature would result if the construction project were undertaken at the proposed location. Based on this information, a go or no-go decision can be made at the end of this phase. The end of a phase gives the project manager the ability to discover, address, and take corrective action against errors discovered during the phase.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK states that phase ending reviews are also known by a few other names: phase exits, phase gates, or kill points.\\n\\nThere are times when phases are overlapped to shorten or compress the project schedule. This is called fast tracking. Fast tracking means that a later phase is started prior to completing and approving the phase, or phases, that come before it. This technique is used to shorten the overall duration of the project.\\n\\nMost projects follow phase sequences within a project life cycle and, as a result, have the fol-\\n\\nlowing characteristics in common: In the beginning phase, which is where the project is initi- ated, costs are low and there are few team members assigned to the project. As the project progresses, costs and staffing increase and then taper off at the closing phase. The potential that the project will come to a successful ending is lowest at the beginning of the project; its chance for success increases as the project progresses through its phases and life cycle stages. Risk is highest at the beginning of the project and gradually decreases the closer the project comes to completion. Stakeholders have the greatest chance of influencing the project and the character- istics of the product or service of the project in the beginning phases and have less and less influ- ence as the project progresses. This same phenomenon exists within the project management processes as well. We’ll look at those next.\\n\\nProject Management Process Groups\\n\\nProject management processes organize and describe the work of the project. A Guide to the PMBOK describes five process groups used to accomplish this end. These processes are per- formed by people and, much like project phases, are interrelated and dependent on one another.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK documents five project management process groups:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\n(cid:1) Monitoring and Controlling\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nClosing\\n\\nAll of these process groups have individual processes that collectively make up the group. For\\n\\nexample, the Initiating process group has two processes called Develop Project Charter and Develop Preliminary Project Scope Statement. Collectively, these process groups—including all their individual processes—make up the project management process. Projects start with the\\n\\n3601.book  Page 23  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes\\n\\n23\\n\\nInitiating process and progress through all the processes in the Planning process group, the Exe- cuting process group, and so on until the project is successfully completed or it’s canceled. All projects must complete the Closing processes, even if the project is killed. Phase handoffs (the design phase handoff to manufacturing, for example) also occur within these life cycles.\\n\\nDon’t confuse project phases and life cycles with the project management pro- cess groups. A Guide to the PMBOK makes a strong point of this. Project phases and life cycles describe how the work associated with the product of the project will be completed. For example, a construction project may have phases such as feasibility study, design, build, inspection, turnover. The five project management process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitor- ing and Controlling, Closing) organize and describe how the project activities will be conducted in order to meet the project requirements. These processes are generally performed for each phase of a large project. The five process groups are the heart of A Guide to the PMBOK and the exam. As you progress through this book, be certain you understand each of these processes as they’re described in A Guide to the PMBOK.\\n\\nLet’s start with a high-level overview of each process group. The remainder of this book will cover each of these processes in detail. If you want to peek ahead, Appendix A lists each of the process groups, the individual processes that make up each process group, and the Knowledge Area they belong in. (I’ll cover knowledge areas in the section titled “The Project Management Knowledge Areas” later in this chapter.)\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nThe Initiating process group, as its name implies, occurs at the beginning of the project and at the beginning of each project phase for large projects. Initiating acknowledges that a project, or the next project phase, should begin. This process group grants the approval to commit the organi- zation’s resources to working on the project or phase and authorizes the project manager to begin working on the project. The outputs of the Initiating process group, including the project charter and preliminary project scope statement, become inputs into the Planning group.\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nThe Planning process is the process group of formulating and revising project goals and objec- tives and creating the project management plan that will be used to achieve the goals the project was undertaken to address. The Planning process group also involves determining alternative courses of action and selecting from among the best of those to produce the project’s goals. This process group is where the project requirements are fleshed out and stakeholders are identified. Planning has more processes than any of the other project management process groups. The Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing process groups all rely on the Planning processes and the documentation produced during the Planning processes in order to carry out their functions. Project managers will perform frequent iterations of the Planning processes prior to project completion. Projects are unique and, as such, have never been done before. Therefore, Planning must encompass all areas of project management and consider budgets,\\n\\n3601.book  Page 24  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n24\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nactivity definition, scope planning, schedule development, risk identification, staff acquisition, procurement planning, and more. The greatest conflicts a project manger will encounter in this process group are project prioritization issues.\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nThe Executing process group involves putting the project management plan into action. It’s here that the project manager will coordinate and direct project resources to meet the objectives of the project plan. The Executing process keeps the project plan on track and ensures that future execution of project plans stays in line with project objectives. This process group is typically where approved changes are implemented. The Executing process group will utilize the most project time and resources, and as a result, costs are usually highest during the Executing pro- cess. Project managers will experience the greatest conflicts over schedules in this cycle.\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nThe Monitoring and Controlling process group is where project performance measurements are taken and analyzed to determine if the project is staying true to the project plan. The idea is to identify problems as soon as possible and apply corrective action to control the work of the project and assure successful outcomes. For example, if you discover that variances exist, you’ll apply corrective action to get the project activities realigned with the project plan. This might require additional passes through the Planning processes to adjust project activities, resources, schedules, budgets, and so on.\\n\\nClosing\\n\\nThe Closing process group is probably the most often skipped process group in project man- agement. Closing brings a formal, orderly end to the activities of a project phase or to the project itself. Once the project objectives have been met, most of us are ready to move on to the next project. However, Closing is important because all the project information is gathered now and stored for future reference. The documentation collected during the Closing process group can be reviewed and utilized to avert potential problems on future projects. Contract closeout occurs here, and formal acceptance and approval are obtained from project stakeholders.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe project manager and project team are responsible for determining which processes within each process group are appropriate for the project you’re working on. This is called tailoring. You should take into consideration the size and complexity of the project and the various inputs and outputs of each of the processes when determining which processes to implement and perform. Small independent projects may not require the rigor of each of the processes within a process group, but every process should be addressed and its level of implementation determined. Use your judgment when deciding which processes to follow, particularly for small projects.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 25  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes\\n\\n25\\n\\nCharacteristics of the Process Groups\\n\\nThe progression through the project management process groups exhibit the same characteris- tics as progression through the project phases do. That is, costs are lowest during the Initiating processes and few team members are involved. Costs and staffing increase in the Executing pro- cess group and then decrease as you approach the Closing process group. The chances for suc- cess are lowest during Initiating and highest during Closing. The chances for risks occurring are higher during Initiating, Planning, and Executing, but the impacts of risks are greater during the later processes. Stakeholders have the greatest influence during the Initiating and Planning pro- cesses and less and less influence as you progress through Executing, Monitoring and Control- ling, and Closing. To give you a better idea of when certain characteristics influence a project, refer to Table 1.3 and Table 1.4. A recap of the characteristics in the beginning and ending pro- cess groups are shown here.\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 3\\n\\nCharacteristics of the Initiating and Planning Process Groups\\n\\nLow Impact or Probability\\n\\nHigh Impact or Probability\\n\\nCosts\\n\\nRisk occurrences\\n\\nStaffing levels\\n\\nStakeholder influence\\n\\nChance for successful completion\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 4\\n\\nCharacteristics of the Monitoring and Controlling and Closing Process Groups\\n\\nLow Impact or Probability\\n\\nHigh Impact or Probability\\n\\nStakeholder influence\\n\\nChance for successful completion\\n\\nStaffing levels\\n\\nRisk probability\\n\\nRisk impact\\n\\nRemember that costs and resources are usually highest during the Executing phase.\\n\\nThe Process Flow\\n\\nThe five process groups should not be thought of as one-time processes that are performed as discrete elements. Rather, these processes interact and overlap with each other. They are itera- tive and may be revisited and revised throughout the project’s life several times as the project is refined. A Guide to the PMBOK calls this process of going back through the process groups an iterative process. The conclusion of each process group allows the project manager and\\n\\n3601.book  Page 26  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n26\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nstakeholders to re-examine the business needs of the project and determine if the project is sat- isfying those needs. And it is another opportunity to make a go or no-go decision.\\n\\nFigure 1.7 shows the five process groups in a typical project. Keep in mind that during phases of a project, the Closing process group can provide input to the Initiating process group. For example, once the feasibility study discussed earlier is accepted or closed, it becomes input to the Initiating process group of the design phase.\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 . 7\\n\\nProject management process groups\\n\\nProject Management Process Groups\\n\\nInputs\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nMonitoring and\\n\\nControlling\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nMonitoring and\\n\\nControlling\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nMonitoring and\\n\\nControlling\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nOutputs\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nMonitoring\\n\\nand Controlling\\n\\nClosing\\n\\nMonitoring and\\n\\nControlling\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nClosing\\n\\nIt’s important to understand the flow of these processes for the exam. If you remember the pro- cesses and their inputs and outputs, it will help you when you’re trying to decipher an exam ques- tion. The outputs of one process group become the inputs into the next process group (or the outputs may be a deliverable of the project). Sometimes just understanding which process the question is ask- ing about will help you determine the answer. One trick you can use to memorize these processes is to remember syrup of ipecac. You probably have some of this poison antidote in your medicine cab- inet at home. If you think of the Monitoring and Controlling process group as simply “Controlling,” when you sound out the first initial of each of the processes, it sounds like “ipecac”—IPECC (Initi- ating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).\\n\\nAs I stated earlier, individual processes make up each of the process groups. For example, the Clos- ing life cycle process group consists of two processes: Close Project and Contract Closure. Each pro- cess takes inputs and uses them in conjunction with various tools and techniques to produce outputs.\\n\\nIt’s outside the scope of this book to explain all the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs for each process in each process group (although each is listed in Appendix A). You’ll find each input, tool and technique, and output detailed in A Guide to the PMBOK, and I highly recommend you get familiar with them.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 27  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes\\n\\n27\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand each project management process group and all of the processes that make up these groups. Appendix A contains a table of all of the process, their inputs, tools and tech- niques, outputs, and the Knowledge Area they each belong in. (We’ll cover knowledge areas in the section titled “The Project Management Knowledge Areas” later in this chapter.)\\n\\nThere are test questions regarding inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of many of the\\n\\nprocesses within each process group. One way to keep them all straight is to remember that tools and techniques usually require action of some sort, be it measuring, applying some skill or technique, planning, or using expert judgment. Outputs are usually in the form of a deliverable. Remember that a deliverable is characterized with results or outcomes that can be measured, are tangible, and are provable. Last but not least, outputs from one process sometimes serve as inputs to another process.\\n\\nProcess Interactions\\n\\nWe’ve covered a lot of material but there’s one more concept I want to explain before we move on to the next section. As stated earlier, project managers must determine the processes that are appropriate for effectively managing a project based on the complexity and scope of the project, available resources, budget, and so on. As the project progresses, the project management pro- cesses may be revisited and revised to update the project management plan as more information becomes known. Underlying the concept that process groups are iterative is a cycle A Guide to the PMBOK describes as the “Plan-Do-Check-Act” cycle that was originally defined by Walter Shewhart and later modified by Edward Deming. The idea behind this concept is that each ele- ment in the cycle is results oriented. The results from the Plan cycle become inputs into the Do cycle and so on, much like the way the project management process groups interact. The cycle interactions can be mapped to work in conjunction with the five project management process groups. For example, the Plan cycle maps to the Planning process group. Before we go any fur- ther, let’s do a brief refresher.\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nProject phases describe how the work required to produce the product of the project will be completed\\n\\nProject management process groups organize and describe how the project activities will be completed in order to meet the goals of the project\\n\\nThe Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle is an underlying concept that shows the integrative nature of the process groups\\n\\nFigure 1.8 shows the relationships and interactions of the concepts we’ve learned so far. Please bear in mind that a simple figure can’t get across all the interactions and iterative nature of these interactions; however, I think you’ll see that the figure ties the basic elements of these concepts together.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 28  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n28\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 . 8\\n\\nProject management process groups\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nProject Phase\\n\\n(Feasibility Study)\\n\\nPlan\\n\\nDo\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nProject Management\\n\\nProcess Groups\\n\\nMonitoring\\n\\nand Control\\n\\nAct\\n\\nMonitoring\\n\\nand Control\\n\\nCheck\\n\\nClosing\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nProject Phase\\n\\n(Design)\\n\\nThe Project Management Knowledge Areas\\n\\nThere is one more way to classify the processes from each project management process group. A Guide to the PMBOK groups these processes into nine categories that they call the Project Management Knowledge Areas. These groupings, or knowledge areas, bring together processes that have characteristics in common. For example, the Project Cost Management knowledge area involves all aspects of the budgeting process, as you would suspect. Therefore, processes such as Cost Estimating, Cost Budgeting, and Cost Control belong to this knowledge area. Here’s the tricky part—these processes don’t belong to the same project management process groups (Cost Estimating and Cost Budgeting are part of the Planning process group and Cost Control is part of the Monitoring and Controlling process group). Think of it this way: knowl- edge areas bring together processes by commonalities, whereas project management process\\n\\n3601.book  Page 29  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nThe Project Management Knowledge Areas\\n\\n29\\n\\ngroups are more or less the order you perform the project management processes (although remember you can come back through these processes more than once). The nine knowledge areas are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nProject Integration Management\\n\\nProject Scope Management\\n\\nProject Time Management\\n\\nProject Cost Management\\n\\nProject Quality Management\\n\\nProject Human Resource Management\\n\\nProject Communications Management\\n\\nProject Risk Management\\n\\nProject Procurement Management\\n\\nLet’s take a closer look at each knowledge area so you understand how they relate to the pro- cess groups. Included in each of the following subsections is a table that illustrates the processes that make up that knowledge area and the project management process group that each process belongs to. This will help you to see the big picture in terms of process groups compared to knowledge areas. We’ll be discussing each of the processes in the various knowledge areas throughout the book, but for now, let’s take a high-level look at each of them.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe PMP exam will most likely have a question or two regarding the processes that make up a knowledge area. Remember that knowledge areas bring together processes by commonali- ties, so thinking about the knowledge area itself should tip you off to the processes that belong to it. Projects are executed in process group order, but the knowledge areas allow a project manager to think about groups of processes that require specific skills. This makes the job of assigning resources easier because team members with specific skills might be able to work on and complete several processes at once. To broaden your understanding of the knowledge areas, cross-reference the purposes and the processes that make up each knowledge area with A Guide to the PMBOK.\\n\\nProject Integration Management\\n\\nProject Integration Management (see Table 1.5) comprises seven processes:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nDevelop Project Charter\\n\\nDevelop Preliminary Project Scope Statement\\n\\nDevelop Project Management Plan\\n\\nDirect and Manage Project Execution\\n\\n3601.book  Page 30  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n30\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\n(cid:1) Monitor and Control Project Work\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control\\n\\nClose Project\\n\\nThe Project Integration Management knowledge area is concerned with coordinating all aspects of the project plan and is highly interactive. This knowledge area involves identifying and defining the work of the project and combining, unifying, and integrating the appropriate processes. This knowledge area also takes into account satisfactorily meeting the requirements of the customer and stakeholder and managing their expectations.\\n\\nProject planning, project execution, monitoring project work, and change control occur throughout the project and are repeated continuously while working on the project. Project planning and execution involve weighing the objectives of the project against the alternatives to bring the project to a successful completion. This includes making choices about how to effec- tively use resources and coordinating the work of the project on a continuous basis. Monitoring the work of the project involves anticipating potential problems and issues and dealing with them before they reach the critical point. Change control impacts the project plan, which in turn impacts the work of the project, which in turn can impact the project management plan, so you can see that these processes are very tightly linked. The processes in this area, as with all the knowledge areas, also interact with other processes in the remaining knowledge areas. For example, the Close Project process uses outputs from the Contract Administration process and produces inputs to the Contract Closure process.\\n\\nThe Project Integration Management knowledge area has two tools for assisting with process integration: Earned Value Management and project management software. Earned Value Man- agement (EVM) is a project-integrating methodology used in this knowledge area to integrate the processes and measure project performance through a project’s life cycle. We’ll further define EVM and talk more about project management software tools in Chapter 7, “Creating the Project Schedule and Budget.”\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 5\\n\\nProject Integration Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nDevelop Project Charter\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nDevelop Preliminary Project Scope Statement\\n\\nInitiating\\n\\nDevelop Project Management Plan\\n\\nDirect and Manage Project Execution\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nMonitor and Control Project Work\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nClose Project\\n\\nClosing\\n\\n3601.book  Page 31  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nThe Project Management Knowledge Areas\\n\\n31\\n\\nProject Scope Management\\n\\nProject Scope Management (see Table 1.6) has five processes:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nScope Planning\\n\\nScope Definition\\n\\nCreate WBS\\n\\nScope Verification\\n\\nScope Control\\n\\nProject Scope Management is concerned with defining all of the work of the project and only the work needed to successfully meet the project goals. These processes are highly interactive. They define and control what is and what is not part of the project. Each process occurs at least once—and often many times—throughout the project’s life.\\n\\nProject Scope Management encompasses both product scope and project scope. Product scope concerns the characteristics of the product or service or result of the project. It’s measured against the product requirements to determine successful completion or fulfillment. The appli- cation area usually dictates the process tools and techniques you’ll use to define and manage product scope. Project scope involves managing the work of the project and only the work of the project. Project scope is measured against the project management plan, the project scope statement, the work breakdown structure (WBS) and the WBS dictionary.\\n\\nTo ensure a successful project, both product and project scope must be well integrated. This implies that Project Scope Management is well integrated with the other knowledge area processes.\\n\\nScope Planning, Scope Definition, Create WBS, Scope Verification, and Scope Control\\n\\ninvolve the following:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nDetailing the requirements of the product of the project\\n\\nVerifying those details using measurement techniques\\n\\nCreating a project scope management plan\\n\\nCreating a work breakdown structure\\n\\nControlling changes to these processes\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 6\\n\\nProject Scope Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nScope Planning\\n\\nScope Definition\\n\\nCreate WBS\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\n3601.book  Page 32  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n32\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 6\\n\\nProject Scope Management (continued)\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nScope Verification\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nScope Control\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nProject Time Management\\n\\nThe Project Time Management knowledge area, shown in Table 1.7, has six processes:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nActivity Definition\\n\\nActivity Sequencing\\n\\nActivity Resource Estimating\\n\\nActivity Duration Estimating\\n\\nSchedule Development\\n\\nSchedule Control\\n\\nThis knowledge area is concerned with estimating the duration of the project plan activities, devis- ing a project schedule, and monitoring and controlling deviations from the schedule. Collectively, this knowledge area deals with completing the project in a timely manner. Time management is an impor- tant aspect of project management because it concerns keeping the project activities on track and monitoring those activities against the project plan to ensure that the project is completed on time.\\n\\nWhile each process in this knowledge area occurs at least once in every project (and sometimes more), in many cases, particularly on small projects, Activity Sequencing, Activity Duration Esti- mating, and Schedule Development are completed as one activity. Only one person is needed to complete these processes for small projects, and they’re all worked on at the same time.\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 7\\n\\nProject Time Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nActivity Definition\\n\\nActivity Sequencing\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nActivity Resource Estimating\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nActivity Duration Estimating\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSchedule Development\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSchedule Control\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\n3601.book  Page 33  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nThe Project Management Knowledge Areas\\n\\n33\\n\\nProject Cost Management\\n\\nAs its name implies, the Project Cost Management knowledge area centers around costs and budgets. The processes that make up this knowledge area are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nCost Estimating\\n\\nCost Budgeting\\n\\nCost Control\\n\\nYou can see how they work together in Table 1.8. The activities in the Project Cost Management knowledge area establish cost estimates for resources, establish budgets, and keep watch over those costs to ensure that the project stays within the approved budget. This knowledge area is primarily concerned with the costs of resources, but other costs should be considered as well. For example, make certain to examine ongoing maintenance and support costs for software you’re considering for the project.\\n\\nDepending on the complexity of the project, these processes might need the involvement of\\n\\nmore than one person. For example, the finance person might not have expertise about the resources documented in the staffing management plan so the project manager will need to bring in a staff member with those skills to assist with the activities in this process.\\n\\nTwo techniques are used in this knowledge area to decide among alternatives and improve the project process: life-cycle costing and Value Engineering. The life-cycle costing technique consid- ers a group of costs collectively (such as acquisition, operations, disposal, and so on) when decid- ing among or comparing alternatives. The Value Engineering technique helps improve project schedules, profits, quality, and resource usage and optimizes life-cycle costs, among others. These techniques can improve decision making, reduce costs, reduce activity durations, and improve the quality of the deliverables. Some application areas require additional financial analysis to help predict project performance. Techniques such as payback analysis, return on investment, and dis- counted cash flows are a few of the tools used to accomplish this.\\n\\nWe’ll discuss these techniques and others in further detail in Chapter 2.\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 8\\n\\nProject Cost Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nCost Estimating\\n\\nCost Budgeting\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nCost Control\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\n3601.book  Page 34  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n34\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nProject Quality Management\\n\\nThe Project Quality Management knowledge area assures that the project meets the require- ments that it was undertaken to produce. This knowledge area focuses on product quality as well as on the quality of the project management process used during the project. These pro- cesses measure overall performance and monitor project results and compare them to the qual- ity standards set out in the project-planning process to assure the customer will receive the product or service they commissioned.\\n\\nAs you can see from Table 1.9, Project Quality Management is composed of the following three processes: Quality Planning, Perform Quality Assurance, and Perform Quality Control.\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 9\\n\\nProject Quality Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nQuality Planning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nPerform Quality Assurance\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nPerform Quality Control\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nProject Human Resource Management\\n\\nProject Human Resource Management involves all aspects of people management and personal interaction, including leading, coaching, dealing with conflict, performance appraisals, and more. These processes ensure that the human resources assigned to the project are used in the most effective way possible. Some of the project participants whom you’ll get to practice these skills on include stakeholders, team members, and customers. Each requires the use of different communication styles, leadership skills, and team-building skills. A good project manager knows when to enact certain skills and communication styles based on the situation.\\n\\nProjects are unique and temporary and so usually are project teams. Teams are put together based on the skills and resources needed to complete the activities of the project, and many times project team members may not know one another. Because the makeup of each team is different and the stakeholders involved in the various stages of the project may change, you’ll use different techniques at different times throughout the project to manage the processes in this knowledge area.\\n\\nThe Project Human Resource Management knowledge area contains the following processes:\\n\\n(cid:1) Human Resources Planning\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nAcquire Project Team\\n\\nDevelop Project Team\\n\\n(cid:1) Manage Project Team\\n\\nTake a look at Table 1.10 to see a visual overview of Project Human Resource Management.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 35  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nThe Project Management Knowledge Areas\\n\\n35\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 1 0\\n\\nProject Human Resource Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nAcquire Project Team\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nDevelop Project Team\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nManage Project Team\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nProject Communications Management\\n\\nThe following processes make up the Project Communications Management knowledge area:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nCommunications Planning\\n\\nInformation Distribution\\n\\nPerformance Reporting\\n\\n(cid:1) Manage Stakeholders\\n\\nThe processes in the Project Communications Management knowledge area are related to gen- eral communication skills, but they encompass much more than an exchange of information. Com- munication skills are considered general management skills that the project manager utilizes on a daily basis. The processes in the Process Communications Management knowledge area seek to ensure that all project information—including project plans, risk assessments, meeting notes, and more—is collected, documented, archived, and disposed of at the proper time. These processes also ensure that information is distributed and shared with stakeholders, management, and project mem- bers at appropriate times. When the project is closed, the information is archived and used as a ref- erence for future projects. This is referred to as historical information in several project processes. Everyone on the project has some involvement with this knowledge area because all project mem- bers will send and/or receive project communication throughout the life of the project. It is impor- tant that all team members and stakeholders understand how communication affects the project.\\n\\nTable 1.11 shows the Project Communications Management process in progress.\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 1 1\\n\\nProject Communication Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nCommunications Planning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nInformation Distribution\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\n3601.book  Page 36  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n36\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 1 1\\n\\nProject Communication Management (continued)\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nPerformance Reporting\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nManage Stakeholders\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nProject Risk Management\\n\\nProject Risk Management, as seen in Table 1.12, contains six processes:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nRisk Management Planning\\n\\nRisk Identification\\n\\n(cid:1) Qualitative Risk Analysis\\n\\n(cid:1) Quantitative Risk Analysis\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nRisk Response Planning\\n\\nRisk Monitoring and Control\\n\\nRisks include both threats to and opportunities within the project. The processes in this knowledge area are concerned with identifying, analyzing, and planning for potential risks, both positive and negative, that may impact the project. This means minimizing the probability and impact of negative risks while maximizing the probability and impact of positive risks. These processes are also used to identify the positive consequences of risk and exploit them to improve project objectives or discover efficiencies that may improve project performance.\\n\\nOrganizations will often combine several of these processes into one step. For example, Risk Identification, Qualitative Risk Analysis, and Quantitative Risk Analysis might be performed at the same time. The important thing about the Project Risk Management knowledge area is that you should strive to identify all the risks and develop responses for those with the greatest con- sequences to the project objectives.\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 1 2\\n\\nProject Risk Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nRisk Management Planning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nRisk Identification\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nQualitative Risk Analysis\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nQuantitative Risk Analysis\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\n3601.book  Page 37  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nThe Project Management Knowledge Areas\\n\\n37\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 1 2\\n\\nProject Risk Management (continued)\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nRisk Response Planning\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nRisk Monitoring and Control\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nProject Procurement Management\\n\\nThe Project Procurement Management knowledge area includes the processes involved with pur- chasing goods or services from vendors, contractors, suppliers, and others outside the project team. When discussing the Project Procurement Management processes, it’s assumed that the dis- cussion is taking place from your perspective as a buyer while sellers are external to the project team. Interestingly, the seller may manage their work as a project, particularly when the work is performed on contract, and you as the buyer become a key stakeholder in their project.\\n\\nThe processes in the Project Procurement Management knowledge area, shown in Table 1.13,\\n\\nare as follows:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nPlan Purchases and Acquisitions\\n\\nPlan Contracting\\n\\nRequest Seller Responses\\n\\nSelect Sellers\\n\\nContract Administration\\n\\nContract Closure\\n\\nT A B L E 1 . 1 3\\n\\nProject Procurement Management\\n\\nProcess Name\\n\\nProject Management Process Group\\n\\nPlan Purchases and Acquisitions\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nPlan Contracting\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nRequest Seller Reponses\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nSelect Sellers\\n\\nExecuting\\n\\nContract Administration\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nContract Closure\\n\\nClosing\\n\\n3601.book  Page 38  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n38\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nThe remainder of this book will deal with processes and process groups as they occur in order (i.e., Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing), as this is the way you will encounter and manage them during a project.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPhew! We covered a lot of ground in this chapter. We learned that projects exist to bring about a unique product, service, or result. Projects are temporary in nature and have definite begin- ning and ending dates.\\n\\nStakeholders are those people or organizations that have a vested interest in the outcome of\\n\\nthe project. Stakeholders include people like the project sponsor, the customer, key manage- ment personnel, the project manager, contractors, suppliers, and more. Projects are considered complete when the project meets or exceeds the expectations of the stakeholders.\\n\\nProject management is a discipline that brings together a set of tools and techniques to describe, organize, and monitor the work of project activities. Project managers are the ones responsible for carrying out these activities. Projects may be organized into programs or port- folios and may be managed centrally by a PMO.\\n\\nProject managers have a wide variety of skills. Not only should they be versed in the field they’re working in, but in general management skills as well. Communication is the most impor- tant skill a project manager will use in the course of a project.\\n\\nOrganizational structures come in variations of three forms: functional, projectized, and\\n\\nmatrix organizations. Functional organizations are traditional with hierarchical reporting structures. Project managers have little to no authority in this organization. Projectized organi- zations are structured around project work, and staff personnel report to project managers. Project managers have full authority in this organizational structure. Matrix organizations are a combination of the functional and projectized. A project manager’s authority varies depend- ing on the structure of the matrix, be it a weak matrix, a balanced matrix, or a strong matrix. Projects progress through phases along a life cycle path to complete the product of the project. The project management process groups are performed throughout the project’s life cycle. The process groups described in A Guide to the PMBOK are Initiating, Planning, Exe- cuting, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Additionally, there are nine knowledge areas that bring together processes that have characteristics in common.\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to describe the difference between projects and operations. A project is temporary in nature with a definite beginning and ending date. Projects produce unique products, services, or results. Operations are ongoing and use repetitive processes that typically produce the same result over and over.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 39  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\n39\\n\\nBe able to denote some of the skills every good project manager should possess. Communi- cation, budgeting, organizational, problem solving, negotiation and influencing, leading, and team building are skills a project manager should possess.\\n\\nBe able to differentiate the different organizational structures and the project manager’s author- ity in each. Organizations are usually structured in some combination of the following: func- tional, projectized, and matrix (including weak matrix, balanced matrix, and strong matrix). Project managers have the most authority in a projectized organization and the least amount of authority in a functional organization.\\n\\nBe able to name the five project management processes. The five project management pro- cesses are Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.\\n\\nBe able to name the nine Project Management Knowledge Areas. The nine Project Manage- ment Knowledge Areas are Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management, Project Time Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management, Project Human Resource Management, Project Communications Management, Project Risk Manage- ment, and Project Procurement Management.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 40  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n40\\n\\nChapter 1 (cid:1) What Is a Project?\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

The Project Management Institute (PMI) is the industry-recognized standard for project man-\\n\\nagement practices.\\n\\n2. B. Projects exist to create a unique product or service. The logon screen in this question is not a unique product. A minor change has been requested, indicating this is an ongoing operation function. Some of the criteria for projects are that they are unique, temporary with definitive start and end dates, and considered complete when the project goals are achieved.\\n\\n3. A. This is a project. The product line is new, which implies that this is a unique product—it\\n\\nhasn’t been done before. We can discern a definite start and end date by the fact that the new appliances must be ready by the spring catalog release.\\n\\n4. D. Progressive elaboration is the process of determining the characteristics and features of the product of the project. Progressive elaboration is carried out in steps in detailed fashion.\\n\\n5. D. A project is considered successful when stakeholder needs and expectations are met or exceeded.\\n\\n6. B. Conflicts between stakeholders should always be resolved in favor of the customer. This ques- tion emphasizes the importance of identifying your stakeholders and their needs as early as pos- sible in the project. We’ll discuss this more in later chapters.\\n\\n7. C. Project management brings together a set of tools and techniques to organize project activi-\\n\\nties. Project managers are the ones responsible for managing the project processes.\\n\\n8. B. Project Integration Management is made up of Project Plan Development, Project Plan Exe-\\n\\ncution, and Integrated Change Control.\\n\\n9. D. Project Time Management involves the following processes: Activity Definition, Activity Sequencing, Activity Duration Estimating, Schedule Development, and Schedule Control.\\n\\n10. A. Negotiation and influencing skills are needed to convince Jack’s boss and come to agreement\\n\\nconcerning his assignment.\\n\\n11. A. The storyboard is a deliverable. Phase endings are characterized by the completion, review, and approval of the deliverable. The next phase should not begin until the deliverable is approved.\\n\\n12. C. Negotiate with the functional manager to participate in the business analyst’s annual perfor-\\n\\nmance review.\\n\\n13. B. The level of authority the project manager has is determined by the organizational structure. For instance, in a functional organization, the project manager has little to no authority, but in a projectized structure, the project manager has full authority.\\n\\n14. A. An advantage for employees in a functional organization is that they have only one supervisor\\n\\nand a clear chain of command exists.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 47  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nAnswers to Review Questions\\n\\n47\\n\\n15. D. Employees in a balanced matrix often report to two or more managers. Functional managers and project managers share authority and responsibility for projects. There is a balance of power between the functional managers and project managers.\\n\\n16. C. Projectized organizations are focused on the project itself. One issue with this type of struc- ture is determining what to do with project team members when they are not actively involved on the project. One alternative is to release them when they are no longer needed.\\n\\n17. D. Remember the acronym that sounds like syrup of ipecac: IPECC (Initiating, Planning, Exe-\\n\\ncuting, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).\\n\\n18. B. Fast tracking is starting a new phase before the phase you’re working on is completed. This\\n\\ncompresses the project schedule, and as a result, the project is completed sooner.\\n\\n19. C. The Initiating process is where stakeholders have the greatest ability to influence outcomes of the project. Risk is highest during this stage because of the high degree of unknown factors.\\n\\n20. A. The Planning process is where requirements are fleshed out, stakeholders are identified, and\\n\\nestimates on project costs and time are made.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 48  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n3601.book  Page 49  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nChapter\\n\\n2\\n\\nCreating the\\n\\nProject Charter and\\n\\nPreliminary Scope\\n\\nStatement\\n\\nTHE PMP EXAM CONTENT FROM THE INITIATING THE PROJECT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nConduct Project Selection Methods\\n\\nDefine Scope\\n\\nDocument Project Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints\\n\\nIdentify and Perform Stakeholder Analysis\\n\\nDevelop Project Charter\\n\\nObtain Project Charter Approval\\n\\nTHE PMP EXAM CONTENT FROM THE PLANNING THE PROJECT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nConduct Kick\\n\\n\\n\\noff Meeting\\n\\n3601.book  Page 50  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nNow that you’re fully armed with a detailed overview of project management, you can easily determine if your next assignment really is a project or an ongoing operation. You’ve also learned some of the basics of good project management techniques and the knowledge areas where you might need specific expertise. We’re going to start putting those techniques into practice during the Initiating process group, which is where all projects start. And, as you’ve probably already guessed, we’ll be using some of the general management skills outlined in Chapter 1, “What Is a Project?”\\n\\nOne of the first skills you will put to use will be your communication skills. Are you sur- prised? Of course you’re not. It all starts with communication. You can’t start defining the project until you’ve first talked to the project sponsor, key stakeholders, and management per- sonnel. All good project managers have honed their communication skills to a nice sharp edge. You’ll remember from Chapter 1 that Initiating is the first process group in the five project\\n\\nmanagement process groups. You can think of it as the official project kickoff. Initiating acknowledges that the project, or the next phase in an active project, should begin. This process group culminates in the publication of a project charter and a preliminary project scope state- ment. We’ll cover each in this chapter.\\n\\nAt the end of this chapter, I’ll introduce a case study that will illustrate the main points of the chapter. We’ll take this case study with us from chapter to chapter and begin building a project using each of the skills we learn.\\n\\nHow Projects Come About\\n\\nYour company’s quarterly meeting is scheduled for today. You take your seat, and each of the department heads gets up and gives their usual “We can do it” rah-rah speech, one after the other. You sit up a little straighter when the CEO takes the stage. He starts out his part of the program pretty much the same way the other department heads did, and before long you find yourself drift- ing off. You are mentally reviewing the status of your current project when suddenly your day- dreaming trance is shattered. You perk up as you hear the CEO say, “…and the new phone system will be installed by Thanksgiving.”\\n\\nWait a minute. You work in the telecom department and haven’t heard a word about this project until today. You also have a funny feeling that you’ve been elected to manage this project. It’s amazing how good communication skills are so important for project managers but not…well, we won’t go there.\\n\\nProject\\n\\ninitiation\\n\\nis the formal recognition that a project, or the next phase in an existing\\n\\nproject, should begin and resources should be committed to the project. Unfortunately, many\\n\\n3601.book  Page 51  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nHow Projects Come About\\n\\n51\\n\\nprojects are initiated the way the CEO did in this example. Each of us, at one time or another, has experienced being handed a project with little to no information and told to “make it hap- to initiate a project. pen.” The new phone system scenario is an excellent example of how Taking one step back leads you to ask, “How do projects come about in the first place? Do\\n\\nnot\\n\\nCEOs just make them up as in this example?” Even though your CEO announced this new project at the company meeting with no forewarning, there is no doubt it came about as a result of a legitimate need. Believe it or not, CEOs don’t just dream projects up to give you something to do. They’re concerned about the future of the company and the needs of the business and its customers.\\n\\nThe business itself might drive the need for a project, customers might demand changes to A Guide products, or legal requirements may create the need for a new project. According to projects come about as a result of one of six needs or demands. Once those to the PMBOK, needs and demands are identified, the next logical step might include performing a feasibility study to determine the viability of the project. We’ll look at these topics next.\\n\\nNeeds and Demands\\n\\nOrganizations exist to generate profits or serve the public. To stay competitive, organizations are always examining new ways of creating business, better ways of gaining efficiencies, or bet- ter ways to serve their customers. Sometimes laws are passed to force organizations to make their products safer or to less harmful to the environment. Projects result from all of these needs. Most projects will fit one of the six needs and demands described in the following list. It is those needs and demands that dictate the germination of a project. Needs and demands can also take the form of a business requirement, an opportunity, or a problem. Let’s take a closer look at each of these areas:\\n\\nThe demands of the marketplace can drive the need for a project. For\\n\\nMarket demand example, a bank initiates a project to offer customers the ability to apply for mortgage loans over the Internet due to a drop in interest rates and an increase in demand for refinancing and new home loans.\\n\\nThe new phone system talked about earlier that was announced at the quarterly\\n\\nBusiness need meeting came about as a result of a business need. The CEO, on advice from his staff, was advised that call volumes were maxed on the existing system. Without a new system, customer service response times would suffer, and that would eventually affect the bottom line.\\n\\nCustomer requests run the gamut. Generally speaking, most companies\\n\\nCustomer request have customers, and their requests can drive new projects. Customers can be internal or external to the organization. Government agencies don’t have external customers per se (we’re captive customers at any rate), but there are internal customers within departments and across agencies.\\n\\nPerhaps you work for a company that sells remittance-processing equipment and you’ve just landed a contract with a local utility company. This project is driven by the need of the utility company to automate its process or upgrade its existing process. The utility company’s request to purchase your equipment and consulting services is the project driver.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 52  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n52\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nTechnological advance Do you happen to own one of those electronic personal digital assis- tants? They keep names and addresses handy and usually come with a calendar and a to-do list of some kind. I couldn’t live without mine. However, there is always a newer, better version coming to market. The introduction of satellite communications now allows these little devices to connect to the Web or get e-mail almost anywhere in the world. The introduction of satellite communications is an example of a technological advance. Due to this introduction, electronics manufacturers revamped their products to take advantage of this new technology.\\n\\nPrivate industry and government agencies both generate new projects as a Legal requirement result of laws passed every legislative season. For example, new sales tax laws might require new programming to the existing sales tax system. The requirement that food labels appear on every package describing the ingredients and the recommended daily allowances is another example of a project driven by legal requirements.\\n\\nSocial need The last need is a result of social demands. For example, perhaps a developing country is experiencing a fast-spreading disease that’s infecting large portions of the popula- tion. Medical supplies and facilities are needed to vaccinate and cure those infected with the disease. Another example might include cleaning up waste products from the water supply of manufacturing plants prior to putting the water back into a local river or stream to prevent contamination.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand each of the needs and demands that bring about a project for the exam.\\n\\nAll of these needs and demands represent opportunities, business requirements, or problems that need to be solved. Management must decide how to respond to these needs and demands, which will more often than not initiate new projects.\\n\\nFeasibility Studies\\n\\nAfter the opportunity for a project becomes evident, the next step might be to go ahead and ini- tiate it, which means you’re ready to jump right into creating a project charter for the project. But before you take that plunge, you should know that some organizations will require a fea- sibility study prior to making a final decision about starting the project.\\n\\nFeasibility studies\\n\\nare undertaken for several reasons. One is to determine if the project is a viable project. A second reason is to determine the probability of the project succeeding. Feasibility studies can also examine the viability of the product of the project. For example, the study might ask, “Will the new lemon-flavored soda be a hit? Or is it marketable?” The study might also look at the technical issues related to the project and determine if the tech- nology proposed is feasible, reliable, and easily assimilated into the organization’s existing technology structure.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 53  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nHow Projects Come About\\n\\n53\\n\\nFeasibility studies may be conducted as separate projects, as subprojects, or as the first life cycle phase of the project. When you don’t know the outcome of the study, it’s best to treat it as a separate project. The group of people conducting the feasibility study should not be the same ones who will work on the project. Project team members may have built-in biases toward the project and will tend to influence the feasibility outcome toward those biases.\\n\\nThe Interactive Voice Response Tax-Filing System\\n\\nJason, Sam, and Kate are web programmers working for the Department of Revenue in the State of Bliss. Ron, their manager, approaches them one day with an idea.\\n\\n“Team, business unit managers are thinking it would be a great idea to offer taxpayers the abil- ity to file their income tax returns over the telephone. We already offer them the ability to file on the Internet, thanks to all your efforts on that project last year. It’s been a fabulous success. No other state has had the success that Bliss has had with our Internet system.”\\n\\n“Kate, I know you’ve had previous experience with IVR technology, but I’m not sure about you guys, so this is new territory for us. I’d like to hear what each of you thinks about this project.”\\n\\nJason speaks up first. “I think it’s a great idea. You know me, I’m always up for learning new things, especially when it comes to programming. When can we start?”\\n\\nSam echoes Jason’s comments.\\n\\n“This technology is pretty sophisticated,” Kate says. “Jason and Sam are excellent coders and could work on the programming side of things, but I would have to pick up the telephony piece on my own. After we’re up and running, we could go over the telephony portions step by step, so Jason and Sam can help me support it going forward. I’d really like to take on this project. It would be good for the team and good for the department.”\\n\\nRon thinks for a minute. “Let’s not jump right into this. I know you’re anxious to get started, but I think a feasibility study is in order. The senior director of the tax business unit doesn’t know if this project is cost justified and has some concerns about its life span. A feasibility study will tell us the answers to those questions. It should also help us determine if we’re using the right technology to accomplish our goals, and it will outline alternative ways of performing the project that we haven’t thought of. I don’t want Kate going it alone without first examining all the issues and potential impacts to the organization.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 54  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n54\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nKicking Off the Project Charter\\n\\nOur first stop in the Initiating group is a process called Develop the Project Charter. As the name of the process suggests, our purpose is to create a project charter. As we talked about in Chapter 1, the purpose for the Initiating group is to authorize a project, or the next phase of a project, to begin. It also gives the project manager the authority to apply resources to the project. These are also the purposes of a project charter: formally authorizing the project to begin and committing resources.\\n\\nThe charter contains several elements which we’ll discuss in the section “For- malizing and Publishing the Project Charter” later in this chapter.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand the purposes of the project charter for the exam.\\n\\nAs you’ll discover, every process has inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs and this one\\n\\nis no exception. We’ll start with the inputs. Let’s get to it.\\n\\nProject Charter Inputs\\n\\nInputs to the project processes are typically informational in nature or they are outputs from previously completed processes. Inputs are used in combination with the tools and techniques to produce the outputs of each process. Process outputs are usually tangible, like a report or an update or a list, for example. In order to get to the output, we have to start with the inputs. Let’s take a look at the Develop Project Charter process inputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nContract (where applicable)\\n\\nProject statement of work\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nThe first input, a contract, is applicable only when the organization you are working for is\\n\\nperforming a project for a customer external to the organization. The contract is used as an input to this process because it typically documents the conditions under which the project will be executed, the time frame, and a description of the work.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 55  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nKicking Off the Project Charter\\n\\n55\\n\\nProject Statement of Work\\n\\nproject statement of work (SOW)\\n\\nThe describes the product or service the project was under- taken to complete. This is usually a document written by either the project sponsor or the ini- tiator of the project. When the project is external to the organization, the SOW is typically written by the buyer. For example, suppose you work for a consulting firm and have been assigned as the project manager for a project your company is performing on contract. The cus- tomer, the organization you’ll be performing the project for, is the one who wrote the SOW.\\n\\nAccording to\\n\\nfollowing elements:\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\na project SOW should contain or consider all of the\\n\\nThe business need for the project here relates to the needs of the organization\\n\\nBusiness need itself. The need may be based on training, governmental standards, technological advances, market demands, or a legal requirement.\\n\\nProduct scope description product or service of the project. The product scope description should be documented and should also include a description of the relationship between the business need or demand that’s driving the project and the products being created.\\n\\nThe product scope description describes the characteristics of the\\n\\nProduct descriptions contain less detail in the early phases of a project and more detail as the project progresses. Product scope descriptions, like the work of the project, are progressively elaborated. They will contain the greatest amount of detail in the project Executing processes.\\n\\nWhen a project is performed under contract, typically the buyer of the product or service will provide the product description to the vendor or contractor. The product description can serve as a statement of work when the project is contracted to a vendor. A statement of work describes the product or service in enough detail so that the vendor can accurately price the contract and satisfactorily fulfill the requirements of the project.\\n\\nStrategic plan Part of the responsibility of a project manager during the Initiating processes is to take into consideration the company’s strategic plan. Perhaps the strategic plan states that one of the company goals is to build 15 new stores by the end of the next fiscal year. If your project entails installing a new human resources software system, it would make sense to write the requirements for your project with the 15 new stores in mind. Your management team will refer to the strategic plan when choosing which new projects to initiate and which ones to drop, depending on their relationship to the strategic vision of the company.\\n\\nEnterprise Environmental Factors\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors input shows up as an input to many of the other processes we’ll discuss throughout the book. This input refers to the factors outside of the project itself A Guide that have (or may have) significant influence on the success of the project. According to to the PMBOK,\\n\\nthe environmental factors include the following:\\n\\nOrganizational or company culture and structure and their influence on the organization in Chapter 1.\\n\\nWe talked about organizational structures\\n\\n3601.book  Page 56  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n56\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nGovernmental or industry standards These include elements like regulatory standards and regulations (for instance, doctors must be licensed to practice medicine on people or pets), quality standards (International Standards Organization standards, for example), product standards, and workmanship standards.\\n\\nInfrastructure include information technology in this category, even though PMI doesn’t mention it.\\n\\nThis refers to the organization’s facilities and capital equipment.

For example, perhaps the folks assigned to your project are junior level and don’t have the skills, experience, or knowledge needed to complete the work of the project. It’s up to the project manager to understand the organization’s environmental factors and account for and consider how they can influence the management and outcomes of the project.\\n\\nOrganizational Process Assets\\n\\nrefers to the organization’s policies, guidelines, procedures, plans,\\n\\nOrganizational process assets approaches, or standards for conducting work, including project work. This includes a wide range of elements that may affect several aspects of the project, such as project management pol- icies, safety policies, performance measurement criteria, templates, financial controls, commu- nication requirements, issue and defect management procedures, change control procedures, risk control procedures, and the procedures used for authorizing work.\\n\\nOrganizational process assets also includes the information the organization has learned on previous projects (including how to store and retrieve that information). For example, previous project risks, performance measurements, earned value data, and schedules for past projects are valuable resources of knowledge for the current project. This information is also known as his- torical information. If you don’t capture and store this information, however, it won’t be avail- able when starting a new project. You’ll want to capture and store information such as project financial data (budgets, costs, overruns), historical information, lessons learned, project files, issues and defects, process measurements, and configuration management knowledge.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 57  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUsing Tools and Techniques for Charter Development\\n\\n57\\n\\nThere are several elements included in the organizational process assets title, and I’ll cover of each of them in later chapters of the book.\\n\\nOrganizational process assets and historical information should be reviewed and examined when starting a new project. Historical information can be very useful to project managers and to stakeholders. When you’re evaluating new projects, historical information about previous projects of a similar nature can be very handy in determining if the new project should be accepted and initiated. Historical information gathered and documented during an active project is used to assist in determining whether the project should proceed to the next phase. Historical information will help you with the project charter, preliminary project scope state- ment, project scope statement, development of the project management plan, the process of defining and estimating activities, and more during the project-planning processes.\\n\\nUnderstanding previous projects of a similar nature—their problems, successes, issues, and outcomes—will help you avoid repeating mistakes while reusing successful techniques to accomplish the goals of this project to the satisfaction of the stakeholders. Many of the processes in the project management process groups have organizational process assets as an input, implying that you should review the pertinent organizational assets that apply for the process you’re about to start. For example, when performing the Cost Estimating pro- cess, you may find it helpful to review the activity estimates and budgets on past projects of similar size and scope before estimating the costs for the activities on the new project.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nMake certain you understand what the organizational process assets entail for the exam.\\n\\nUsing Tools and Techniques for Charter Development\\n\\nThe Develop Project Charter process has four tools and techniques you can use to help you pro- duce the project charter. They are project selection methods, project management methodology, project management information system, and expert judgment. We’ll look at each one next.\\n\\nSelecting and Prioritizing Projects\\n\\nMost organizations don’t have the luxury of performing every project that’s proposed. Even consulting organizations that sell their project management services must pick and choose which projects they want to work on. Selection methods help organizations decide among alternative\\n\\n3601.book  Page 58  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n58\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nprojects. The project selection methods tool and technique calculates measurable differences between projects and determines the tangible benefits to the company of choosing or not choosing the project.\\n\\nProject selection methods will vary depending on the company, the people serving on the selection committee, the criteria used, and the project. Sometimes selection methods will be purely financial, sometimes purely marketing, and sometimes they’ll be based on public percep- tion or political perception. In most cases, the decision is based on a combination of all of these and more.\\n\\nMost organizations have a formal, or at least semiformal, process for selecting and prior- itizing projects. In my organization, a steering committee is responsible for project review, is a group of folks comprising senior man- selection, and prioritization. A agers and sometimes midlevel managers who represent each of the functional areas in the organization.\\n\\nsteering committee\\n\\nHere’s how our process works: The steering committee requests project ideas from the business staff prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. These project ideas are submitted in writing and contain a high-level overview of the project goals, a description of the deliver- ables, the business justification for the project, a desired implementation date, what the organization stands to gain from implementing the project, a list of the functional business areas affected by the project, and if applicable, a cost-benefit analysis (we’ll talk about that in a bit).\\n\\nA meeting is called to review the projects and a determination is made on each project as to whether it will be included on the upcoming list of projects for the new year. Once the no-go projects have been weeded out, the remaining projects are prioritized according to their importance and benefit to the organization. The projects are documented on an official project list, and progress is reported on the active projects at the regular monthly steering committee meetings.\\n\\nIn theory, it’s a great idea. In practice, it works only moderately well. Priorities can and do change throughout the year. New projects come up that weren’t originally submitted during the call for projects and they must be added to the list. Reprioritization begins anew, and resource alignment and assignments are shuffled. But again, we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Just be aware that organizations usually have a process to recognize and screen project requests, accept or reject those requests based on some selection criteria, and prioritize the projects based on some criteria.\\n\\nThe project selection methods we’ll talk about next are ones you should know and understand for the exam. However, keep in mind they are only one aspect of project selec- tion in the real world. The individual opinion, and power, of selection committee members also plays a part in the projects the organization chooses to perform. Don’t underestimate the importance of the authority, political standing, and individual aspirations of selection committee members. Those committee members who happen to carry a lot of weight in company circles, so to speak, are likely to get their projects approved just on the fact that they are who they are. This is sometimes how project selection works in my organization. How about yours?\\n\\n3601.book  Page 59  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUsing Tools and Techniques for Charter Development\\n\\n59\\n\\nUsing Project Selection Methods\\n\\nProject selection methods are concerned with the advantages or merits of the product of the project. In other words, selection methods measure the value of what the product or ser- vice of the project will produce and how it will benefit the organization. Selection methods involve the types of concerns executive managers are typically thinking about. This includes factors like market share, financial benefits, return on investment, customer retention and loyalty, and public perceptions. They are used to evaluate and choose between alternative ways of performing the project.\\n\\nAccording to\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nbenefit deci- measurement methods Decision models examine different criteria used in mak- sion models ing decisions regarding project selection, while calculation methods provide a way to calculate the value of the project, which is then used in project selection decision making.\\n\\nthere are two categories of selection methods:\\n\\nThese selection methods are known as\\n\\nmathematical models.\\n\\ncalculation methods.\\n\\nand\\n\\nand\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nCross-reference your understanding of benefit measurement methods and mathematical mod- els with the descriptions provided in\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK.\\n\\nMathematical Models\\n\\nFor the exam, all you need to understand about mathematical models is that they use linear, dynamic, integer, nonlinear, and/or multi-objective programming in the form of algorithms— or in other words, a specific set of steps to solve a particular problem. These are complicated mathematical formulas and algorithms that are beyond the scope of this book and require an engineering, statistical, or mathematical background to fully understand. Organizations con- sidering undertaking projects of enormous complexity may use mathematical modeling tech- niques to make decisions regarding these projects. Mathematical models are also known as constrained optimization methods. benefit measurement methods to make project selection decisions.\\n\\nThe vast majority of project selection techniques will use the\\n\\nBenefit Measurement Methods\\n\\nBenefit measurement methods employ various forms of analysis and comparative approaches to make project decisions. These methods include comparative approaches such as cost-benefit, scoring models, and benefit contribution methods that include various cash flow techniques and economic models. We’ll examine several of these methods, starting with cost-benefit.\\n\\nCost\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefit Analysis\\n\\nOne common benefit measurement method is the analysis. The name of this method implies what it does—it compares the cost to produce the product or service of the project to the benefit (usually financial in the form of savings or revenue generation) the organization will\\n\\ncost\\n\\n\\n\\nbenefit\\n\\n3601.book  Page 60  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n60\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nreceive as a result of executing the project. Obviously, a sound project choice is one where the costs to implement or produce the product of the project are less than the financial benefits. How much less is the organization’s decision. Some companies are comfortable with a small margin, while others are comfortable with a much larger margin between the two figures.\\n\\nWhen examining costs for a cost-benefit analysis, include the costs to produce the product or service, the costs to take the product to market, and ongoing operational support costs. For example, let’s say your company is considering writing and marketing a database software product that will allow banks to dissect their customer base, determine which types of custom- ers buy which types of products, and then market more effectively to those customers. You will take into account some of the following costs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe costs to develop the software, such as programmer costs, hardware costs, testing, and testing costs.\\n\\nMarketing costs such as advertising, traveling costs to perform demos at potential customer sites, and so on.\\n\\n(cid:2) Ongoing costs such as having a customer support staff available during business hours to\\n\\nassist customers with product questions and problems.\\n\\nLet’s say the cost to produce this software plus the ongoing support costs total $5 million. Initial projections look like the demand for this product is high. Over a three-year period, the potential life of the software in its proposed form, projected revenues are $12 million. Taking only the financial information into account, the benefits outweigh the costs of this project. This project should receive a go recommendation.\\n\\nProjects of significant cost or complexity usually involve more than one benefit measurement method when go or no-go decisions are being made or one project is being chosen over another. Keep in mind that selection methods can take subjective considerations into account as well—the project is a go because it’s the new CEO’s pet project; nothing else needs to be said.\\n\\nScoring Models\\n\\nAnother project selection technique in the benefit measurement category is a scoring model, or weighted scoring model. My organization uses weighted scoring models not only to choose between projects, but also as a method to choose between competing bids on out- sourced projects.\\n\\nWeighted scoring models are quite simple. The project selection committee decides on the criteria that will be used on the scoring model—for example, profit potential, marketability of the product or service, the ability of the company to quickly and easily produce the product or service, and so on. Each of these criteria is assigned a weight depending on its importance to the project committee. More important criteria should carry a higher weight than less important criteria.\\n\\nThen each project is rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (or some such assignment), with the higher number being the more desirable outcome to the company and the lower number having the\\n\\n3601.book  Page 61  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUsing Tools and Techniques for Charter Development\\n\\n61\\n\\nopposite effect. This rating is then multiplied by the weight of the criteria factor and added to other weighted criteria scores for a total weighted score. Let’s look at an example that brings this together (see Table 2.1).\\n\\nT A B L E 2 . 1 Weighted Scoring Model\\n\\nCriteria\\n\\nProfit potential\\n\\nMarketability\\n\\nEase to produce/support\\n\\nWeighted score\\n\\n5 = highest\\n\\nWeight\\n\\nProject A\\n\\nScore\\n\\n\\n\\nProject B\\n\\nScore\\n\\n\\n\\nProject C\\n\\nScore\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n—\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n41\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n37\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n29\\n\\nIn this example, Project A is the obvious choice.\\n\\nCash Flow Analysis Techniques\\n\\nThe remaining benefit measurement methods involve a variety of cash flow analysis techniques, including payback period, discounted cash flows, net present value, and internal rate of return. We’ll look at each of these techniques individually, and I’ll provide you with a crash course on their meanings and calculations.\\n\\nPAYBACK PERIOD The payback period is the length of time it takes the company to recoup the initial costs of pro- ducing the product or service of the project. This method compares the initial investment to the cash inflows expected over the life of the product or service. For example, say the initial invest- ment on a project is $200,000, with expected cash inflows of $25,000 per quarter every quarter for the first two years and $50,000 per quarter from then on. The payback period is two years and can be calculated as follows:\\n\\nInitial investment = $200,000 Cash inflows = $25,000 × 4 (quarters in a year) = $100,000/year total inflow\\n\\nInitial investment ($200,000) – year 1 inflows ($100,000) = $100,000 remaining balance\\n\\nYear 1 inflows remaining balance – year 2 inflows = $0\\n\\nTotal cash flow year 1 and year 2 = $200,000\\n\\nPayback is reached in two years.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 62  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n62\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nThe fact that inflows are $50,000 per quarter starting in year 3 makes no difference because\\n\\npayback is reached in two years.\\n\\nPayback period is the least precise of all the cash flow calculations. That’s because payback period does not consider the value of the cash inflows made in later years, commonly called the time value of money. For example, if you have a project with a five-year payback period, the cash inflows in year 5 are worth less than they are if you received them today. The next section will explain this idea more fully.\\n\\nDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS As I just stated, money received in the future is worth less than money received today. The reason for that is the time value of money. If I borrowed $2,000 from you today and promised to pay it back in three years, you would expect me to pay interest in addition to the original amount bor- rowed. Okay, if you were a family member or a really close friend maybe you wouldn’t, but ordi- narily this is the way it works. You would have had the use of the $2,000 had you not lent it to me. If you had invested the money (does this bring back memories of your mom telling you to save your money?), you’d receive a return on it. Therefore, the future value of the $2,000 you lent me today is $2,315.25 in three years from now at 5 percent interest per year. Here’s the formula for future value calculations:\\n\\nFV = PV(1 + i)n\\n\\nIn English, this formula says the future value (FV) of the investment equals the present value\\n\\n(PV) times (1 plus the interest rate) raised to the value of the number of time periods (n) the interest is paid. Let’s plug in the numbers:\\n\\nFV = 2,000(1.05)3\\n\\nFV = 2,000(1.157625)\\n\\nFV = $2,315.25\\n\\nThe discounted cash flow technique compares the value of the future cash flows of the project to today’s dollars. In order to calculate discounted cash flows, you need to know the value of the investment in today’s terms, or the present value (PV). PV is calculated as follows:\\n\\nPV = FV ÷ (1 + i)n\\n\\nThis is the reverse of the FV formula talked about earlier. So, if we ask the question, “What is $2,315.25 in three years from now worth today given a 5 percent interest rate?” we’d use the preceding formula. Let’s try it:\\n\\nPV = $2,315.25 ÷ (1 + .05)3 PV = $2,315.25 ÷ 1.157625\\n\\nPV = 2,000\\n\\n$2,315.25 in three years from now is worth $2,000 today. Discounted cash flow is calculated just like this for the projects you’re comparing for selec- tion purposes or when considering alternative ways of doing the project. Apply the PV formula to the projects you’re considering and then compare the discounted cash flows of all the projects\\n\\n3601.book  Page 63  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUsing Tools and Techniques for Charter Development\\n\\n63\\n\\nagainst each other to make a selection. Here is an example comparison of two projects using this technique:\\n\\nProject A is expected to make $100,000 in two years.\\n\\nProject B is expected to make $120,000 in three years.\\n\\nIf the cost of capital is 12 percent, which project should you choose?\\n\\nUsing the PV formula used previously, calculate each project’s worth.\\n\\nThe PV of Project A = $79,719.\\n\\nThe PV of Project B = $85,414.\\n\\nProject B is the project that will return the highest investment to the company and should be\\n\\nchosen over Project A.\\n\\nNET PRESENT VALUE Projects may begin with a company investing some amount of money into the project to com- plete and accomplish its goals. In return, the company expects to receive revenues, or cash inflows, from the resulting project. Net present value (NPV) allows you to calculate an accu- rate value for the project in today’s dollars. The mathematical formula for NPV is compli- cated, and you do not need to memorize it in that form for the test. However, you do need to know how to calculate NPV for the exam, so I’ve given you some examples of a less- complicated way to perform this calculation in Tables 2.2 and 2.3 using the formulas you’ve already seen.\\n\\nNet present value works like discounted cash flows in that you bring the value of future mon- ies received into today’s dollars. With NPV, you evaluate the cash inflows using the discounted cash flow technique applied to each period the inflows are expected instead of in one sum. The total present value of the cash flows is then deducted from your initial investment to determine NPV. NPV assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the cost of capital.\\n\\nHere’s the rule: If the NPV calculation is greater than zero, accept the project. If the NPV cal-\\n\\nculation is less than zero, reject the project.\\n\\nLook at the two project examples in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. Project A and Project B have total cash inflows that are the same at the end of the project, but the amount of inflows at each period differs for each project. We’ll stick with a 12 percent cost of capital. Note that the PV calcula- tions were rounded to two decimal places.\\n\\nT A B L E 2 . 2\\n\\nProject A\\n\\nYear\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\nInflows\\n\\n10,000\\n\\n15,000\\n\\n5,000\\n\\nPV\\n\\n8,929\\n\\n11,958\\n\\n3,559\\n\\n3601.book  Page 64  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n64\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nT A B L E 2 . 2\\n\\nProject A (continued)\\n\\nYear\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nLess investment\\n\\nNPV\\n\\nT A B L E 2 . 3\\n\\nProject B\\n\\nYear\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nLess investment\\n\\nNPV\\n\\nInflows\\n\\n30,000\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\nInflows\\n\\n7,000\\n\\n13,000\\n\\n10,000\\n\\n30,000\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\nPV\\n\\n24,446\\n\\n24,000\\n\\n446\\n\\nPV\\n\\n6,250\\n\\n10,364\\n\\n7,118\\n\\n23,732\\n\\n24,000\\n\\n<268>\\n\\nProject A has an NPV greater than zero and should be accepted. Project B has an NPV less\\n\\nthan zero and should be rejected. When you get a positive value for NPV, it means that the project will earn a return at least equal to or greater than the cost of capital.\\n\\nAnother note on NPV calculations: Projects with high returns early in the project are better projects than projects with lower returns early in the project. In the preceding examples, Project A fits this criterion also.\\n\\nINTERNAL RATE OF RETURN The internal rate of return (IRR) is the most difficult equation to calculate of all the cash flow techniques that we’ve discussed. It is a complicated formula and should be performed on a financial calculator or computer. IRR can be figured manually, but it’s a trial-and-error approach to get to the answer.\\n\\nTechnically speaking, IRR is the discount rate when the present value of the cash inflows equals the original investment. When choosing between projects or when choosing alternative methods of doing the project, projects with higher IRR values are generally considered better than projects with low IRR values.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 65  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUsing Tools and Techniques for Charter Development\\n\\n65\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, you need to know three things concerning IRR:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nIRR is the discount rate when NPV equals zero.\\n\\nIRR assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the IRR value.\\n\\nYou should choose projects with the highest IRR value.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nAlthough A Guide to the PMBOK doesn’t specifically address these cash flow techniques, you’ll likely see exam questions on these topics. They are inferred in A Guide to the PMBOK under the heading “Benefit Measurement Methods.”\\n\\nApplying Project Selection Methods\\n\\nNow that we’ve discussed some of the techniques used in the project selection methods tool and technique, let’s look at how to apply them when choosing projects or project alternatives. One, two, or several of the benefit measurement methods can be used alone or in combination to come up with a selection decision. Remember that payback period is the least precise of all the cash flow techniques, NPV is the most conservative cash flow technique, and NPV and IRR will generally bring you to the same accept/reject conclusion.\\n\\nProject selection methods, and particularly the benefit measurement methods, can be used\\n\\nto evaluate multiple projects or a single project. You might be weighing one project against another or simply considering if the project you’re proposing is worth doing. Remember that project selection methods are a tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process and this tool and technique covers two broad categories called mathematical methods (also known as constrained optimization methods) and benefit measurement methods. Both of these together are often called decision models.\\n\\nProject Management Methodology and\\n\\nInformation Systems\\n\\nThese two techniques are similar so I’ve put them together under the same heading. The project man- agement methodology tool and technique refers to a methodology for managing projects much like A Guide to the PMBOK process groups and all of the processes contained within each of them. A project management methodology may be a formal, recognized project management standard like the one outlined in this book or an informal technique. Whether formal or informal, the methodol- ogy should help the project manager develop the project charter.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 66  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n66\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nFun Days Vacation Resorts\\n\\nJerry is a project manager for Fun Days Vacation Resorts. He is working on three different project proposals to present to the executive steering committee for review. As part of the information-gathering process, Jerry visits the various resorts pretending to be a guest. This gives him a feel for what Fun Days guests experience on their vacations, and it better prepares him to present project particulars and alternatives.\\n\\nJerry has prepared the project overviews for three projects and called upon the experts in mar- keting to help him out with the projected revenue figures. He works up the numbers and finds the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject A—payback period = 5 years; IRR = 8 percent\\n\\nProject B—payback period = 3.5 years; IRR = 3 percent\\n\\nProject C—payback period = 2 years; IRR = 3 percent\\n\\nFunding exists for only one of the projects. Jerry recommends Project A and predicts this is the project the steering committee will choose since the projects are mutually exclusive.\\n\\nJerry’s turn to present comes up at the steering committee. Let’s listen in on the action.\\n\\n“And, on top of all the benefits I’ve just described, Project A provides an IRR of 8 percent, a full 5 percent higher than the other two projects we discussed. I recommend the committee choose Project A.”\\n\\n“Thank you Jerry,” Colleen says. “Good presentation.” Colleen is the executive chairperson of the steering committee and has the authority to break ties or make final decisions when the committee can’t seem to agree.\\n\\n“However, here at Fun Days we like to have our fun sooner rather than later.” Chuckles ensue from the steering committee. They’ve all heard this before. “I do agree that an 8 percent IRR is a terrific return, but the payback is just too far out into the future. There are too many risks and unknowns for us to take on a project with a payback period this long. As you know, our industry is directly impacted by the health of the economy. Anything can happen in five years’ time. I think we’re much better off going with Project C. I recommend we accept Project C. Committee members, do you have anything to add?”\\n\\nProject management information system (PMIS) is listed in this process as a tool and tech- nique. Notice that this is also noted as one of the enterprise environmental factors. A PMIS is a set of automated tools (generally a software program) that allows you to schedule project activities and resources and collect and distribute project information. As a tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process, the PMIS facilitates the creation of the project charter,\\n\\n3601.book  Page 67  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nFormalizing and Publishing the Project Charter\\n\\n67\\n\\nprovides a way to capture feedback and changes to the charter, and publishes the finalized, approved charter.\\n\\nExpert Judgment\\n\\nExpert judgment is the last tool and technique in this process. The concept behind expert judg- ment is to rely on individuals, or groups of people, who have training, specialized knowledge, or skills in the areas you’re assessing. These folks may be stakeholders, consultants, other experts in the organization, or technical or professional organizations. Expert judgment is a tool and technique used in other planning processes as well.\\n\\nIn the case of developing a project charter, expert judgment would be helpful in assessing the inputs of this process, the environmental factors, and organizational assets —that is, the project statement of work, product descriptions, strategic plan, project selection methods, and histor- ical information. For example, as the project manager, you might rely on the expertise of your executive committee to help you understand how the proposed project gels with the strategic plan. Or you might rely on team members who have participated on similar projects in the past to make recommendations regarding the proposed project.\\n\\nFormalizing and Publishing\\n\\nthe Project Charter\\n\\nThe project charter is the official, written acknowledgment and recognition that a project exists. It ties the work of the project with the ongoing operations of the organization. It’s usually issued by senior management and gives the project manager the authority to assign organizational resources to the work of the project.\\n\\nThe charter documents the business need or demand that the project was initiated to address and the project justification, and it includes a description of the product or service of the project. It is usually the first official document of the project once acceptance of the project has been granted. Project charters are often used as a means to introduce a project to the organization. Since this document outlines the high-level project description, the business opportunity or need, and the project’s purpose, executive managers can get a “first glance” look at the benefits of the project. Good project charters that are well documented will address many of the ques- tions your stakeholders are likely to have up front.\\n\\nLet’s take a brief look at the key stakeholders who may be involved with the project charter\\n\\nand the role they’ll play in its development and on the project in the future.\\n\\nKey Stakeholders\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK states that the project sponsor or initiator is the one who provides the infor- mation for the project charter. It also says a manager who is external to the project should publish the charter. However, A Guide to the PMBOK and common project management practices don’t\\n\\n3601.book  Page 68  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n68\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nalways match up. In practice, my experience has been that the project charter is published under the name of the project sponsor. It also involves the input of key stakeholders. Often, the project sponsor or initiator won’t have all the information needed to complete the charter and you’ll be charged with digging out all the facts needed to create this document as well as the preliminary project scope state- ment. But remember, you’re studying to pass the exam, so you should know that A Guide to the PMBOK states that the author of the project charter should be a manager external to the project and input comes from the initiator or sponsor.\\n\\nProject Manager\\n\\nThe project manager is the person who assumes responsibility for the success of the project. The project charter identifies the project manager and describes the authority the project manager has in carrying out the project. The project manager’s primary responsibilities are project planning and then executing and managing the work of the project. By overseeing the project charter and the project planning documents created later on in the project, the project manager is assured that every- one knows and understands what’s expected of them and what constitutes a successful project.\\n\\nProject managers are responsible for setting the standards and policies for the projects they work on. As a project manager, it is your job to establish and communicate the project proce- dures to the project team and stakeholders.\\n\\nProject managers will identify activities and tasks, resource requirements, project costs, project requirements, performance measures, and more. Communication and documentation must become the project manager’s best friends. Keeping stakeholders, the project sponsor, the project team, and all other interested parties informed is “job one,” as the famous car manu- facturer’s ads say.\\n\\nProject Sponsor\\n\\nHave you ever attended a conference or event that was put on by a sponsor? In the information technology field, conferences and seminars are often sponsored by software development compa- nies. The sponsor pays for the event, the facilities, and the goodies and provides an opportunity for vendors to display their wares. In return, the sponsor comes out looking like a winner. Because they are footing the bill for all this fun, the sponsor gets to call the shots on conference content and they get the prime spots for discussing their particular solutions. And last but not least, they usually provide the keynote speaker and get to present their information to a captive audience.\\n\\nProject sponsors are similar to this in that they rally support from stakeholders and the exec- utive management team for the project. The project sponsor is usually an executive in the orga- nization who has the power and authority to make decisions and settle disputes or conflicts regarding the project. The sponsor takes the project into the limelight, so to speak, and gets to call the shots regarding project outcomes. The project sponsor is also the one with the big bucks who provides funds for your project. The project sponsor should be named in the project char- ter and identified as the final authority and decision maker for project issues.\\n\\nSponsors are actively involved in the Initiating and Planning phases of the project and tend to have less involvement during the Execution and Monitoring and Controlling phases. It’s up to the project manager to keep the project sponsor informed of all project activities, project progress, and any conflicts or issues that arise. The sponsor is the one with the authority to resolve conflicts and set priorities when these things can’t be dealt with any other way.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 69  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nFormalizing and Publishing the Project Charter\\n\\n69\\n\\nProject Champion\\n\\nThe project champion is another strong project supporter. Unlike the sponsor, the project champion doesn’t necessarily have a lot of authority or executive powers. The champion helps focus attention on the project from a technical perspective. The project champion is usually someone with a great deal of technical expertise or industry knowledge regarding the project. They can lend credibility to the viability of the project and to the skills and abilities of the key project team members to carry out project activities. Sometimes, the project manager may act as project champion.\\n\\nThe project champion isn’t necessarily identified in the project charter. But as a project manager, you’ll want to know who this person is because they’re a strong project advocate and you might need them later on to help rally support for project decisions.\\n\\nFunctional Managers\\n\\nWe covered functional managers briefly in Chapter 1. Project managers must work with and gain the support of functional managers in order to complete the project. Functional managers fulfill the administrative duties of the organization, provide and assign staff members to projects, and con- duct performance reviews for their staff. It’s a good idea to identify the functional managers who’ll be working on project tasks or assigned project responsibilities in the charter.\\n\\nIt’s also a good idea to identify the key project stakeholders in the project charter. While this isn’t explicitly stated as part of this process, you’ll see in the next section that stakeholder influ- ences make up one of the components of the project charter. In order to identify stakeholder influences, I believe it’s also necessary to identify the stakeholders and describe their role in high-level terms as I’ve done here.\\n\\nPulling the Project Charter Together\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, in order to create a useful and well-documented project charter, you should include at least these elements:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPurpose or justification for the project\\n\\nBusiness need for the project\\n\\nBusiness justification for the project, including return on investment analysis\\n\\n(cid:2) High-level project description or product description\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRequirements that must be completed satisfactorily according to stakeholder, sponsor, and customer expectations\\n\\nStakeholder influences\\n\\nInvolvement of other departments (in the functional organization) and the level of partic- ipation needed\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\nAssumptions\\n\\nSummary milestone schedule (preliminary)\\n\\n3601.book  Page 70  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n70\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSummary budget (preliminary)\\n\\n(cid:2) Name of the project manager and their authority levels\\n\\nWe’ve already discussed some of these elements. The purpose of the project, business need, and business justification were covered in earlier sections of this chapter. In the last section, we talked some about stakeholders and their roles. We’ll cover this topic more thoroughly in the next chapter. The roles or involvement of other departments and their level of participation is a matter of defining the level of involvement and the types of actions required from the other departments to fulfill the purpose and requirements of the project.\\n\\nA constraint is anything that restricts the actions of the project team. Perhaps the project has a hard end date. The date cannot move due to circumstances outside of the control of the project. Or perhaps the project has a set budget. Both of these things are examples of constraints. Assumptions are events or actions believed to be true. Both constraints and assumptions should be documented in the project charter. However, many of these elements are included in the processes related to creating a scope statement and become further refined as you get into the Planning process, so we’ll talk more about these topics in Chapter 3, “Creating the Scope Statement.”\\n\\nThe important thing to remember for the exam about the project charter is that it authorizes the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project, it doc- uments the business need and justification, it describes the customer’s requirements, and it ties the project to the ongoing work of the organization.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nIn some organizations, the project charter might be written by the project manager. However, if you (as the project manager) are asked to write the charter, remember that your name should not appear as the author of the project charter document. Since the project charter authorizes the project and authorizes you as the project manager, it doesn’t make sense for you to write a document authorizing yourself to manage the project. The author of the charter should be an executive manager in your organization (external to the project) with the power and authority to assign resources to this project. Remember for the exam that the charter is authorized exter- nal to the project organization.\\n\\nProject Charter Sign\\n\\n\\n\\noff\\n\\nThe project charter isn’t complete until you’ve received sign-off from the project sponsor, senior management, and key stakeholders. Sign-off indicates that the document has been read by those signing it (let’s hope so, anyway) and that they agree with its contents and are on board with the project. It also involves the major stakeholders right from the beginning and hopefully wins their continued participation in the project going forward. If someone has a problem with any of the elements in the charter, now is the time to raise the red flag.\\n\\nOne of the things I like to do prior to publishing the charter is to hold a kick-off meeting with the key stakeholders to discuss the charter and then obtain their sign-off. While A Guide to the\\n\\n3601.book  Page 71  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping a Preliminary Project Scope Statement\\n\\n71\\n\\nPMBOK doesn’t bring stakeholders into the picture until the Planning processes, I think it’s imperative that you identify your key stakeholders as soon as possible and involve them in the cre- ation of the project charter and preliminary scope statement. Remember for the exam, however, that the initiator or sponsor provides the input for the charter and preliminary scope statement.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about key stakeholder roles in Chapter 3, “Developing the Project Scope Statement.”\\n\\nSigning the project charter document is the equivalent of agreeing to and endorsing the project. This doesn’t mean that the project charter is set in stone, however. Project charters will change throughout the course of the project. As more details are uncovered and outlined and as the Planning processes begin, more project issues will come to light. This is part of the iterative process of project management and is to be expected. The charter will occasionally be revised to reflect these new details, project plans will be revised, and project execution will change to incorporate the new information or direction.\\n\\nThe last step in this process is publishing the charter. Publishing, in this case, simply means distrib- uting a copy of the project charter to the key stakeholders, the customer, the management team, and others who may be involved with the project. Publication can take several forms, including printed format or electronic format distributed via the company e-mail system or on the company’s intranet. Next, I’ll further describe the work of the project in a preliminary project scope statement.\\n\\nDeveloping a Preliminary Project\\n\\nScope Statement\\n\\nThe preliminary scope statement is the first blush, so to speak, of a definition of what the project entails. This preliminary document is a high-level look at the project objectives and deliverables. It serves the purpose of capturing the intended outcome of the project and its deliverables. It provides a brief background of the project and describes the business opportunity the company is attempting to benefit from. It also describes the business objectives the project should meet. The preliminary scope statement is based on information provided by the project sponsor or initiator and lays the groundwork for future consensus on deliverables and project expectations and will be further elaborated in the Scope Definition process that we’ll talk about in Chapter 3.\\n\\nPreliminary Scope Statement Inputs and Techniques\\n\\nThe inputs for this process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject charter\\n\\nProject SOW\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n3601.book  Page 72  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n72\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nWe’ve seen all of these previously in this chapter. Remember that many times, outputs from one process become inputs into the next process. That’s the case here, where you’ll examine the project charter, meet with the project sponsor or initiator, and develop the preliminary project scope statement. Before we get to what the scope statement contains, let’s take a look at the tools and techniques of this process. These will look familiar too.\\n\\nThe tools and techniques for the Develop Preliminary Scope Statement process include project\\n\\nmanagement methodology, project management information system, and expert judgment.\\n\\nThe Preliminary Scope Statement Document\\n\\nThe preliminary scope statement document contains several elements, most of which are repeated in the final scope statement created during the Planning process group. Creating a pre- liminary scope statement is a good thing for very large projects or projects with multiple phases. On large projects, each phase has its own preliminary scope statement document that can be reexamined, revised, and elaborated as the new phase begins. Small- to medium-sized projects probably will not need a preliminary scope statement. You could skip straight to the Planning processes from here, but I urge you, don’t turn the page. You do need to know about this pro- cess for the exam even if you’ll only use it a few times in the course of your project work. And remember, it’s up to the project manager (that’s you) to determine which processes should be completed for the project. My guess is the majority of the time you’ll skip this one.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, understand the purpose of the preliminary scope document, which is to describe the characteristics of the product of the project, what is and what is not included in project scope (A Guide to the PMBOK calls this “boundaries”), how the final product or service of the project will be accepted, and how scope will be controlled.\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, the preliminary scope statement should contain\\n\\nthese elements:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject objectives\\n\\nCharacteristics of the product or service of the project (i.e., a product description)\\n\\nProduct objectives\\n\\nProject deliverables\\n\\nRequirements (both product and project)\\n\\nExclusions from scope (project boundaries)\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\nAssumptions\\n\\n(cid:2) High-level risk list and definition\\n\\n3601.book  Page 73  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nThe Kitchen Heaven Project Case Study\\n\\n73\\n\\n(cid:2) Milestones\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nInitial WBS\\n\\nCost estimate (order of magnitude)\\n\\nConfiguration management requirements\\n\\nProject acceptance criteria\\n\\nI know you’re dying to know more about some of these elements! I don’t mean to keep you in suspense, but it makes a lot more sense to cover these elements when we talk about the scope statement in Chapter 3. You will always create a scope statement for your project, no matter how large or small. (You do this, right?) Besides, we’ve covered a lot of material in these first two chapters and you probably need a little breather to absorb what you’ve learned. Kick back, run through the end-of-chapter questions, and then you’ll be ready to jump into these topics.\\n\\nThe Kitchen Heaven Project Case Study\\n\\nThis chapter introduces a case study that we’ll follow throughout the remainder of the book. You’ll find an updated case study closing out every chapter. They’re designed to show you how a project manager might apply the material covered in the chapter to a real-life project. As hap- pens in real life, not every detail of every process is followed during all projects. Remember that the processes from A Guide to the PMBOK that we’ll cover in the remaining chapters are project management guidelines. You will often combine processes during your projects, which allows you to perform several steps at once. The case studies will present situations or processes that you might find during your projects and describe how one project manager resolves them.\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nYou are a project manager for Kitchen Heaven, a chain of retail stores specializing in kitchen utensils, cookware, dishes, small appliances, and some gourmet food stuffs such as bottled sauces and spices. You’re fairly new to the position, having been hired to replace a PM who recently retired.\\n\\nKitchen Heaven currently owns 49 stores in 34 states and Canada. The world headquarters for Kitchen Heaven is in Denver, Colorado. Counting full-time and part-time employees, the company employs 1,500 people, 200 of whom work in the headquarters office.\\n\\nThe company’s mission statement reads: “Great gadgets for people interested in great food.”\\n\\nRecently, the vice president of marketing came to pay you a visit. Dirk Perrier is a very nice man, well dressed, with the formal air that you would expect a person in his capacity might have. He shakes your hand and gives you a broad, friendly smile.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 74  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n74\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\n“We’ve decided to go forward with our 50th store opening! Sales are up, and our new line of ceramic cookware is a hot seller, no pun intended. I don’t know if you’re familiar with our store phi- losophy, so let me take a moment to explain it. We like to place our stores in neighborhoods that are somewhat affluent. The plain fact is that most of our shoppers have incomes of over $150,000 a year. So, we make an effort to place our stores in areas where those folks normally shop.\\n\\n“We’re interested in targeting the non-gourmet customer, one who’s interested in cooking but won’t be making Peking duck. So, the stores are upbeat and convey a little bit of a laid-back feel, if you will.\\n\\n“Our next store is going to be right here in our home area—Colorado Springs. We have a store in Boulder and one in Denver, but none down south. Because this is going to be our 50th store, we plan on having a 50th grand-opening celebration, with the kind of surprises and activities you might expect for such a notable opening.\\n\\n“Our stores generally occupy from 2,000 to 4,000 square feet of retail space, and we typically use local contractors for the build-out. A store build-out usually takes 120 days from the date the property has been procured until the doors open to the public. I can give you our last opening’s project plan so you have a feel for what happens. Your job will be to procure the property, nego- tiate the lease, procure the shelving and associated store furnishings, get a contractor on the job, and prepare the 50th store festivities. My marketing folks will assist you with that last part.\\n\\n“You have six months to complete the project. Any questions?”\\n\\nYou take in a deep breath and collect your thoughts. Dirk has just given you a lot of information with hardly a pause in between thoughts. A few initial ideas drift through your head while you’re reaching for your notebook.\\n\\nYou work in a functional organization with a separate projectized department responsible for carrying out projects of this nature. You’ve been with the company long enough to know that Dirk is high up there in the executive ranks and carries the authority and the power to make things happen. Therefore, Dirk is the perfect candidate for project sponsor.\\n\\nYou grab your notebook and start documenting some of the things Dirk talked about, clarifying with him as you write:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe project objective is to open a new store in Colorado Springs six months from today.\\n\\nThe store should be located in an affluent area.\\n\\nThe store will carry the full line of products from utensils to gourmet food items.\\n\\nThe grand opening will be accompanied by lots of fanfare because this is the 50th store opening.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 75  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nThe Kitchen Heaven Project Case Study\\n\\n75\\n\\nYou have a question or two for Dirk.\\n\\n“Is there a special reason we have to open…let’s see…six months from now is February 1st?”\\n\\n“Yes, we want the store open the first week in February. Early February is when the Garden and Home Show conference hits the Springs area. We’ll have a trade show booth there. We know from experience in other areas that our stores generally see a surge in sales during this month as a result of the trade show. It’s a great way to get a lot of advertising out there and let folks know where we’re located.”\\n\\n“Another question, Dirk. Is there a budget set for this project yet?”\\n\\n“We haven’t set a hard figure,” Dirk replies. “But again, from past experience we know it takes anywhere from $1.5 to $2 million to open a new store. And we don’t want to forget the big bash for the grand opening.”\\n\\n“Thanks, Dirk. I’ll get started writing the project charter right away. I’ll be putting your name on the document since you’re the project sponsor.”\\n\\nDirk concludes with, “Feel free to come to me with questions or concerns at any time.”\\n\\nOne week later.\\n\\nYou review your notes and reread the project charter you’ve prepared for the Kitchen Heaven retail store one last time before looking for Dirk. You finally run across Dirk in a hallway near the executive washroom.\\n\\n“Dirk, I’m glad I caught you. I’d like to go over the project charter with you before the kickoff meeting tomorrow. Do you have a few minutes?”\\n\\n“Sure,” Dirk says to you. “Let’s have it.”\\n\\n“The project charter states the purpose of the project, which of course is to open the 50th Kitchen Heaven store in Colorado Springs. I also documented some of the high-level require- ments, many of which we talked about last time we met. I documented the assumptions and constraints you gave me with the understanding that we’ll define these much more closely when I create the scope statement. I’ve included a section that outlines a preliminary milestone schedule and I’ve included some preliminary return on investment calculations. Using your estimate of $2 million as our initial budget request and based on the projected inflows you gave me last week, I’ve calculated a payback period of 16 months, with an IRR of 22 percent.”\\n\\n“That’s impressive,” replies Dirk. “Even better than our Phoenix store. If I recall, the payback period there was just over two years. Let’s hope those numbers hold true.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 76  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n76\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\n“I think they’re reliable figures. I researched our data based on recent store openings in similar- sized cities and factored in the economic conditions of the Colorado Springs area. Since they’re on a growth pattern, we think the timing is perfect.”\\n\\n“As you know, the project kickoff is scheduled for tomorrow. What I’ll need then is for you to talk about the project and the goals, talk about the commitment you’ll need from the manage- ment team to support this project, and introduce me as the project manager. I’ve already for- warded a copy of the project charter to the meeting attendees so that they can review it before the meeting. And I included a list of the assumptions we’ve made so far as an appendix to the charter. Lastly, I’ll need you to ask everyone present to sign a copy of the project charter.”\\n\\n“Sounds like you’ve covered everything,” Dirk says. “I don’t anticipate any problems tomor- row, as everyone is looking forward to this store opening.”\\n\\nProject Case Study Checklist\\n\\nProject objective: To open a new store in Colorado Springs six months from today.\\n\\nBusiness need or demand for project: Company data concludes that the Kitchen Heaven consumers have incomes of over $150,000 a year.

Projects come about as a result of one of six needs or demands: market demand, business need, customer requests, tech- nological advances, legal requirements, and social needs.\\n\\nThen we talked about the Develop the Project Charter process. The project statement of work is an input to this process that describes the product or service the project was undertaken to complete. The SOW should include the business needs of the organization and a product scope description and should map to the organization’s strategic plan.\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors are factors outside of the project that may have significant\\n\\ninfluence on the success of the project. Organizational process assets refer to policies, guide- lines, and procedures for conducting the project work.\\n\\nProject selection methods are a tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process.\\n\\nSelection methods include decision models in the form of benefit measurement methods and mathematical models (also called constrained optimization methods). The mathematical meth- ods utilize mathematical models. Benefit measurement methods come in the form of cost-benefit analyses, scoring models, and economic analyses. These are primarily comparative approaches. Besides cost-benefit analysis, the most commonly used form of benefit measurement methods is cash flow analysis.\\n\\nAnalysis of cash flows includes payback period, discounted cash flows, net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). These last three methods are concerned with the time value of money—or in other words, converting future dollars into today’s value. Generally, projects with a shorter payback period are desired over those with longer payback periods. Projects that have an NPV greater than zero should be accepted. Projects with the highest IRR value are considered a better benefit to the organization than projects with low IRR values.\\n\\nExpert judgment is another tool and technique of this process. Experts usually have spe- cialized knowledge or skills and can include staff from other departments in the company, external or internal consultants, and members of professional and technical associations or industry groups.\\n\\nThe output of this process is the project charter, which is the formal recognition that a project, or the next project phase, should begin. The charter authorizes the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project, it documents the business need and justification, it describes the customer’s requirements, and it ties the project to the ongoing work of the organization.\\n\\nThe preliminary project scope statement is a high-level definition of what the project entails, including the project objectives and deliverables. It describes the business opportunity the company is attempting to benefit from and the business objectives the project intends to meet. Many of the elements included in the preliminary scope statement are also part of the project scope statement.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 78  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n78\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to distinguish between the six needs or demands that bring about project creation. The six needs or demands that bring about project creation are market demand, business need, customer requests, technological advances, legal requirements, and social needs.\\n\\nBe able to denote the Develop the Project Charter inputs. The inputs for Develop the Project Charter are contract (where applicable), project statement of work, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets.\\n\\nBe able to define decision models. Decision models are project selection methods that are a tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process. Decision models include benefit measurement methods and mathematical models.\\n\\nBe able to describe and calculate payback period. Payback period is the amount of time it will take the company to recoup its initial investment in the product of the project. It’s calcu- lated by adding up the expected cash inflows and comparing them to the initial investment to determine how many periods it takes for the cash inflows to equal the initial investment.\\n\\nBe able to denote the decision criteria for NPV and IRR. Projects with an NPV greater than zero should be accepted, and those with an NPV less than zero should be rejected. Projects with high IRR values should be accepted over projects with lower IRR values. IRR is the discount rate when NPV is equal to zero, and IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate.\\n\\nBe able to describe the importance of the project charter. The project charter is the docu- ment that officially recognizes and acknowledges that a project exists. The charter authorizes the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project, it doc- uments the business need and justification, it describes the customer’s requirements, and it ties the project to the ongoing work of the organization.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 79  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\n79\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

A. The buyer provides SOW when projects are performed under contract.\\n\\n2. B. This came about due to a business need. Staff members were spending unproductive hours producing information for the management report that wasn’t consistent or meaningful.\\n\\n3. A. Develop Project Charter has four inputs and they are contract, project SOW, enterprise envi-\\n\\nronmental factors, and organizational process assets.\\n\\n4. C. The most correct answer is to perform a feasibility study. Since this project is taking the com- pany into a new, unknown market, there’s lots of potential for error and failure. A feasibility study would help the stakeholders determine if the project is viable and cost effective and whether it has a high potential for success.\\n\\n5. C. The Develop Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement processes both have the follow-\\n\\ning as inputs: project SOW, enterprise environment factors, and organizational process assets. Both processes share the following tools and techniques: project management methodology, PMIS, and expert judgment.\\n\\n6. B. The project SOW should contain the business need for the project and the product scope\\n\\ndescription and should support the organization’s strategic plan.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nB. Historical information on projects of a similar nature can be very helpful when initiating new projects. They can help in formulating project deliverables and identifying constraints and assump- tions and will be helpful further on in the project Planning processes as well.\\n\\n8. D. The product description is a component of the project SOW, which is an input of both the Develop Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement processes. It describes the character- istics of the product or service and contains less detail in the early phases of the project and more detail as the project progresses.\\n\\n9. A. Benefit measurement methods include comparative methods, scoring models, and cash flow analysis, which are all part of the project selection method tools and techniques in the Develop Project Charter process.\\n\\n10. B. Projects with NPV greater than zero should be given an accept recommendation.\\n\\n11. B. Projects with the highest IRR value are favored over projects with lower IRR values.\\n\\n12. A. Net present value (NPV) assumes reinvestment is made at the cost of capital.\\n\\n13. C. Year 1 and 2 inflows are each $100,000 for a total of $200,000. Year 3 inflows are an addi- tional $300,000. Add one more quarter to this total and the $575,000 is reached in three years and three months, or 39 months.\\n\\n14. D. IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate and is the discount rate when NPV is equal to zero.\\n\\n15. C. Mathematical models are one of the methods described in the project selection methods tool\\n\\nand technique of the Develop Project Charter process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 86  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n86\\n\\nChapter 2 (cid:2) Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement\\n\\n16.

You’ve successfully completed the project Initiating processes and published the project charter and the preliminary scope statement. The project is officially under way. Stakeholders have been informed, there is management buy-in on the project, the project manager has been assigned, and the project objectives and description have been identified. A solid foundation for the Planning process is in place.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we will begin the Planning processes for the project. In fact, we will continue discussing the Planning processes through Chapter 7, “Creating the Project Schedule and Bud- get.” Planning is a significant activity in any project and, if done correctly, will go a long way toward ensuring project success.\\n\\nThis chapter begins with the Develop Project Management Plan process. This process will describe the overall approach you’ll use to manage the project. The result of this process is the project management plan document that describes how you’ll execute and monitor and control the project outcomes as the project progresses and how to close out the project once it concludes. Then we’ll move on to the Scope Planning process. You’ll use the project charter and pre- liminary scope statement you created in the last chapter—plus some other inputs—and then apply the tools and techniques of this process to come up with the project scope management plan. From there, you’re off to the Scope Definition process, where you’ll further elaborate the project objectives and deliverables. We’ll talk in depth about project objectives, requirements, constraints, assumptions, and other elements of writing the project scope statement, which is an output of this process.\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Management Plan\\n\\npro- The first process in the Planning process group is the cess. It’s first for good reason. This process is a part of the Integration Management knowledge area and is concerned with defining, coordinating, and integrating all the various ancillary project plans. Remember when we talked about tailoring in Chapter 1?\\n\\nDevelop Project Management Plan\\n\\nThis process involves defining and documenting the processes you’re going to use to manage\\n\\nthis project. For example, let’s say you and the project team have determined you will use project management processes involving costs, human resources, risks, and a project schedule. (Warning: This is a demonstration only—don’t try this at home. In reality, professionals per- form many more processes than this on a typical project.) Each particular process may have a management plan that describes it. For instance, a cost management plan would describe how costs will be managed and controlled and how changes to costs will be approved and managed\\n\\n3601.book  Page 89  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Management Plan\\n\\n89\\n\\nthroughout the project. The Develop Project Management Plan process brings all these subsid- iary plans together, along with the outputs of the Planning group processes, into one document called the\\n\\nproject management plan.\\n\\nIn order to create and document the plan, we need to gather some inputs and build on the\\n\\ninformation we’ve already collected.\\n\\nDeveloping Inputs\\n\\nThere are four inputs into the Develop Project Management Plan:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPreliminary scope statement\\n\\nProject management processes\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nOrganizational process assets here are the same ones we considered when developing the project charter in Chapter 2, “Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement.” There are some important elements to note in the remaining inputs, so let’s take a look.\\n\\nPreliminary scope statement You’ll recall that the preliminary scope statement describes the objectives of the project and the high-level requirements needed to satisfy stakeholder expecta- tions. The reason it’s an input into this process is because the content of the preliminary scope statement—including objectives, product requirements, schedule milestones, and so on—will help you and the team determine exactly which project management processes to use on the project.\\n\\nRemember, you’re studying for the exam, so the correct input into this process is the preliminary scope statement. However, if you’ve skipped that process and only performed the project charter, you could use it as an input to this process.\\n\\nProject management processes The project management processes include all of the individ- ual processes that make up the process groups we’re talking about throughout this book. The Initiating group, for example, has two processes, Planning has a zillion (okay, not that many but it seems like it), and so on. Each of the processes you determine to use on the project will be doc- umented in the project management plan.\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors We’ve seen enterprise environmental factors before. Some of the key elements of the environmental factors you should consider when choosing the pro- cesses to perform for this project include standards and regulations (both industry and govern- mental), company culture, skills and knowledge of existing personnel, risk tolerances of stakeholders, and the project management information system (PMIS).\\n\\nAs we talked about in Chapter 1, the processes you choose to perform for the project will be based on the complexity of the project, the project scope, and the type of industry you work in. Your organization’s standards, guidelines, and policies (a component of organizational process\\n\\n3601.book  Page 90  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n90\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2)\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nassets) or the project management office (PMO) may also dictate the types of processes you’ll use for the project. You should also consider if your organization has existing change control processes in place, templates that you’re required to use, or financial controls and processes. Don’t forget to look for historical information and then use it to help you decide which pro- cesses to use for this project.\\n\\nThe tools and techniques for this process are also familiar. They include project management methodology, expert judgment, and PMIS. We covered expert judgment and project manage- ment methodology in Chapter 2, if you need a refresher.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nlists the PMIS as a tool and technique of some processes\\n\\nas an input (it’s part of the enterprise environmental factors) of others. The PMIS in the\\n\\nBe aware that and Develop Project Management Plan process includes a subsystem called the configuration man- agement system (we’ll cover this in Chapter 9, “Measuring and Controlling Project Perfor- mance”) and the change control system, which is a subsystem of the configuration management system.\\n\\nThe PMIS in this case is an automated system used to document the subsidiary plans and the project management plan, facilitate the feedback process, and revise the documents. It incorporates the configuration management system and the change control system, both of which we’ll cover in Chapter 9. Later in the project, the PMIS can be used to control changes to any of the plans. When you’re thinking about the PMIS as an input (that is, as part of the enterprise environmental factors), think of it as a collection and distribution point for information as well as an easy way to revise and update documents. When you’re thinking about the PMIS as a tool and technique, think of it just that way—as a tool to facilitate the automation of data collection and distribution and to automate and monitor processes like scheduling, resource leveling, budgeting, and web interfaces.\\n\\nDocumenting the Project Management Plan\\n\\nThe purpose of most every process is of course, to get to the output. Outputs are usually a report or document of some type or a deliverable. In this case, we end up with a document—the project management plan—that describes, integrates, and coordinates subsidiary plans for the pro- cesses you’ve determined to use for the project. The project management plan can be detailed or a high-level summary based on the needs of the project. A Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nthe project management plan defines how the project is executed, how it’s monitored and controlled, and how it’s closed. It also documents the out- puts of the Planning group processes, which we’ll cover over the next several chapters.

Each of these subsidiary management plans may contain the same elements as the overall project management plan does only it’s specifically related to the topic at hand. For example, the cost management plan should define how changes to cost estimates will be reflected in the project budget and how changes or variances with a significant impact should be communicated to the project sponsor and stakeholders. The schedule management plan describes how changes to the schedule will be managed, and so on.\\n\\nThe subsidiary plans may be detailed or simply a synopsis, depending on the needs of the project. I’ve listed the subsidiary plans along with a brief description. We will cover each of these plans in more detail throughout the remainder of this book. According to PMBOK,\\n\\nthe subsidiary plans are as follows:\\n\\nA Guide to the\\n\\nProject scope management plan tates creating the work breakdown structure (WBS), describes how the product or service of the project is verified and accepted, and documents how changes to scope will be handled.\\n\\nDescribes the process for determining project scope, facili-\\n\\nSchedule management plan trolled and how changes will be incorporated into the project schedule.\\n\\nDescribes how the project schedule will be developed and con-\\n\\nCost management plan to costs will be approved and managed.\\n\\nDescribes how costs will be managed and controlled and how changes\\n\\nQuality management plan mented.

This analysis focuses on excluding or eliminating inefficiencies and waste.\\n\\nStaffing management plan Describes how human resource requirements for the project will be met, including how staff acquisition will occur and the time frames in which resources are needed.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 92  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n92\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2)\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nCommunications management plan including timing, frequency, and methods of communications.\\n\\nDescribes the communication needs of the stakeholders,\\n\\nDescribes how risks will be managed and controlled during the\\n\\nRisk management plan project. This should include risk management methodology, roles and responsibilities, defini- tions of probability and impact, when project management will be performed, and the catego- ries of risk, risk tolerances, and reporting and tracking formats.\\n\\nDescribes how the procurement processes will be managed Procurement management plan throughout the project. This may include elements such as type of contract, procurement doc- uments, lead times for purchases.\\n\\nThe project management plan is not limited to the subsidiary plans listed here. You may include other plans and documentation that help describe how the project will be executed or monitored and controlled. Perhaps you’re working on a project that requires precise calcula- tions and exact adherence to requirements. You could include a plan that describes these cal- culations, how they’ll be monitored and measured, and the processes you’ll use to make changes or corrections.\\n\\nThere’s one more piece to this output. There are components of each of the processes asso- ciated with the subsidiary plans that should be considered when developing the plans. The com- ponents that\\n\\nrecommends you consider are as follows:\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nMilestone list\\n\\nResource calendar\\n\\nSchedule baseline\\n\\nCost baseline\\n\\nQuality baseline\\n\\nRisk register\\n\\nWe’ll talk about each of these in the remaining chapters as well.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nBe aware that I’m about to get on my soapbox. If you don’t want to indulge me, skip the next few sentences and go to the next paragraph. I find it a little discon- certing that the 2004 version of presents information that the reader has no knowledge of way in advance of learning the process. It’s almost as if you need to be well versed in all the processes before you read the book! You’re going to see several places throughout the remainder of this book where topics are introduced, as in the previous list, that you don’t know anything about yet. Rest assured we will cover these topics in their proper place. If I began to tell you now about the risk management plan and risk register, for example, I’d first have to explain what risks are, the processes involved, and how the risk reg- ister is produced. I think it will make much more sense for you to see these ele- ments in the processes they’re produced in. Thanks…I feel better now.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 93  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nScoping Out the Project\\n\\n93\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand that the purpose of the project management plan is to define how the project is executed, monitored and controlled, and closed, and to document the outputs of the Planning group processes you’ll use during the project.\\n\\nAs the project progresses and more and more processes are performed, there may be changes\\n\\nto the subsidiary plans and to the project management plan itself. These changes should be reviewed and the project management plan should be updated to reflect the approved changes. Depending on the nature of the changes, the project manager, stakeholders, or sponsor (or some combination) should review and approve the changes.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nIn practice, you’ll find that you’ll prepare the project management plan after you’ve progressed through several of the other Planning processes. It’s difficult to create some of these subsidiary plans without performing the process they’re associated with first. However, for the exam, remember that Develop Project Management Plan is the first process in the Planning group and it should be performed first.\\n\\nScoping Out the Project\\n\\nis the first process in the Project Scope Management knowledge area and the Scope Planning second process in the Planning process group. You may recall from Chapter 1 that the purpose of the Project Scope Management knowledge area is to describe and control what is and what is results the project intends to produce.\\n\\nis collectively the product or service of the project and the\\n\\nwork of the project.\\n\\nScope\\n\\nnot\\n\\nThe primary purpose of Scope Planning is to document the scope management plan. This is a planning tool that documents how the project team will go about defining project scope, how the work breakdown structure will be developed, how changes to scope will be controlled, and how project scope will be verified.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about this in the section “Documenting the Scope Management Plan” later in this chapter.\\n\\nFor now let’s concentrate on the inputs to this process, which will help you get started doc-\\n\\numenting the decisions about the Scope Planning process for your project.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 94  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n94\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2)\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nScope Planning Inputs\\n\\nI’m beginning to sound like a broken record…we’ve seen the inputs to the Scope Planning pro- cess before. They are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nProject charter\\n\\nPreliminary project scope statement\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nEven though we’ve talked about these before, there are some specific elements of some of these\\n\\ninputs we’ll want to look at closely. Defining project scope and managing to that scope as you progress through the project has a direct relationship to the success of the project. It’s difficult to doc- ument how you’ll define project scope if you don’t first understand the purpose behind the project, the product or service you’re trying to produce, and the environmental factors and organizational process assets you’re working under. The process of how you’ll go about defining and managing scope is what the scope management plan (which is what we’re ultimately getting to with this pro- cess) is about.\\n\\nOne of the environmental factors that may influence the way scope is managed is the human resources involved on the project. Their skills, knowledge, and ability to communicate and esca- late issues appropriately may influence the way project scope is managed. Personnel policies governing those resources may also have an effect. For example, you may have a team member who has a close relationship with one of the stakeholders. Let’s say the stakeholder wants a change to the project. The stakeholder and team member grab a cup of coffee together at the corner deli and the next thing you know, the team member is incorporating the change into the project. Scope can’t be managed efficiently when it’s being changed without the knowledge of the project manager or project team.\\n\\nOther environmental factors that may affect scope management are the organization’s cul-\\n\\nture, economic conditions, and physical and technological infrastructure.\\n\\nOrganizational process assets typically include things like policies and procedures, whether formal or informal. Your organization’s policies or the policies and guidelines of your industry may have an effect on scope management, so make certain you’re familiar with them. And don’t forget historical information. You can review the scope management plan from previous projects of similar size and scope to help you craft the one for this project.\\n\\nThe project charter and preliminary scope statement describe the purpose and high-level requirements of the project. Analyzing the information in these documents will help you deter- mine the appropriate tools and methodologies to use (as well as which processes to perform) for the project. The idea here is that you want to understand the size and complexity of the project so that you don’t spend more time documenting how you’re going to go about defining and managing scope than what’s needed.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 95  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nScoping Out the Project\\n\\n95\\n\\nScope Planning Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThere are two tools and techniques in Scope Planning:\\n\\nYou’ll rely on the expert judgment of people or groups with specific skills, Expert judgment knowledge, or training to help assess the process inputs. One expert you can count on in this process is the executive manager who wrote or contributed to the project charter. They can clar- ify questions you may have about the project objectives as well as the product description. Stakeholders or other project managers with previous experience on projects similar to yours can help you determine how scope management should work for this project.\\n\\nTemplates, forms, and standards Your PMO may have scope management templates, forms, and standards that you can use to help define the scope management plan. Work breakdown structure templates and scope change control forms may also help because they outline how to break down work of the project and what elements are needed to describe changes.\\n\\nDocumenting the Scope Management Plan\\n\\nThe only output of the Scope Planning process is the This plan describes how the project team will go about defining project scope, verifying the work of the the project project, and managing and controlling scope. According to scope management plan should contain the following:\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nscope management plan.\\n\\nproject\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe process you’ll use to prepare the project scope statement. The project scope statement (which we’ll define later in this chapter) contains a detailed description of what the deliv- erables and requirements of the project are and is based on the information contained in the preliminary scope.\\n\\nA process for creating the work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS (we’ll cover that in the next chapter) further defines the work of the project (as defined in the project scope statement) by breaking down the deliverables into requirements.\\n\\nA definition of how the deliverables will be verified for accuracy and the process used for accepting deliverables.\\n\\nA description of the process for controlling scope change requests, including the procedure for requesting changes and how to obtain a change request form.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe project scope management plan is a planning tool that documents how the project team will go about defining project scope, how the work breakdown structure will be developed, how changes to scope will be controlled, and how the work of the project will be verified and accepted. And don’t forget, the scope management plan is a component of (or a subsidiary of) the project management plan.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 96  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n96\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2)\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nFormulating Scope Definition\\n\\nNow we’re getting to the meat of the project Planning process group. The high-level objectives and deliverables and the initial constraints and assumptions of the project were defined in the prelim- inary scope statement. When we prepared the preliminary scope statement it was, well, prelimi- nary. Now we’re ready to further define these in the Scope Definition process and prepare a detailed project scope statement because more information is known now. The project scope statement (which we’ll get to shortly) is what we’ll use to further break down the work of the project into activities that we can assign to resources.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nYou’ll want to pay particular attention to the accuracy and completeness of this process. Defin- ing project scope is critical to the success of the project since it spells out exactly what the prod- uct or service of the project looks like. Conversely, poor scope definition may lead to cost increases, rework, schedule delays, and poor morale.\\n\\nFirst, we’ll examine the inputs and tools and techniques of this process.\\n\\nDefining the Scope Definition Inputs and Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThe inputs to the Scope Definition process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject charter\\n\\nPreliminary scope management plan\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\nSome of the important information you’ll want to key in on from these inputs are historical infor-\\n\\nmation, the product description, and the project objectives, assumptions, and constraints. (We’ll cover each of these in the section “Writing the Project Scope Statement” later in this chapter.)\\n\\nThe approved change requests input will obviously impact the project scope. They may also impact quality, estimated costs, or the project schedule. As changes are approved, you’ll have to modify the project scope statement (and other planning documents) to reflect them.\\n\\nWe’re going to see some new tools and techniques in this process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProduct analysis\\n\\nAlternatives identification\\n\\nExpert judgment\\n\\nStakeholder analysis\\n\\n3601.book  Page 97  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nFormulating Scope Definition\\n\\n97\\n\\nWe’ve covered expert judgment before. We’ll cover product analysis, alternatives identifica-\\n\\ntion, and stakeholders in the following sections.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nIn practice, you’ll often find that you’ll skip over the preliminary scope statement process and begin writing the project scope statement after the charter is documented. However, you’re studying for the exam, so remember that the project scope statement is further elaborated based on the information contained in the preliminary scope statement. Most of the informa- tion found in the preliminary scope statement is also found in the project scope statement.\\n\\nAlso note that if the project charter and/or the preliminary project scope statement are missing or were not developed, you should use the product scope description as an input to this process.\\n\\nProduct Analysis\\n\\nProduct analysis goes hand in hand with the product scope description. Product analysis is a method for converting the product description and project objectives into deliverables and requirements. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, product analysis might include perform- ing value analysis, functional analysis, systems-engineering techniques, systems analysis, or value-engineering techniques to further define the product or service.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nIt’s beyond the scope of this book to go into the various analysis techniques used in product analysis. For exam purposes, remember that product analysis is a tool and technique of the Scope Definition process and memorize the list of analysis techniques that might be performed in this process.\\n\\nAlternatives Identification\\n\\nAlternatives identification is a technique used for discovering different methods or ways of accomplishing the project. For example, brainstorming might be used to discover alternative ways of implementing one of the project objectives. Perhaps the project’s budget doesn’t allow for a portion of the project that the stakeholders really think needs to be included. Brainstorm- ing might uncover an alternative that would allow the needed portion to be accomplished. Lateral thinking is a form of alternatives identifications that can be used to help define scope. Edward de Bono created this term and has done extensive research and writing on the topic of lateral thinking. The simplest definition is that it’s thinking outside the box. Lateral thinking is a process of separating the problem—or in our case the components of project scope (the deliverables and require- ments)—looking at them from different angles than their obvious presentation, and encouraging team members to come up with ways to solve problems or look at scope that are not apparently obvious.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 98  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n98\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2) Developing the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nStakeholder Analysis\\n\\nDuring stakeholder analysis, you’ll want to identify the influences stakeholders have in regard to the project and understand their expectations, needs, and desires. From there, you’ll derive more specifics regarding the project goals and deliverables. Be warned that stakeholders are mostly concerned about their own interests and what they (or their organization) have to gain or lose from the project. In all fairness, we all fall into the stakeholder category, so we’re all guilty of focusing on those things that impact us most.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK doesn’t heavily reference stakeholders prior to this pro- cess. You’ll recall they state that the information for the project charter and pre- liminary scope statement comes from the project requestor or sponsor. In practice, you’ll want to bring your stakeholders into the project as early in the process as you can, preferably when the project charter or preliminary scope statement is being written.\\n\\nYour objective at this point is to begin defining exactly what the stakeholders’ expectations are of project outcomes. This should include information like the project’s objectives and how you’ll recognize when the project is successfully completed. At the end of this identification and analysis process, you’ll be able to describe and prioritize their expectations in terms of project requirements. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. We’ll define objectives and requirements shortly. Let’s discover who those stakeholders are first.\\n\\nIdentifying Stakeholders\\n\\nThink of stakeholders and project participants as a highly polished orchestra. Each participant has a part to play. Some play more than others, and alas, some play their parts better than oth- ers. An integral part of project management is getting to know your stakeholders and the parts they play. You’ll remember from Chapter 1 that stakeholders are those people or organizations who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project. They have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project and have the ability to influence project results. Stakeholders are officially identified in the Planning process. In practice, key stakeholders will have to be con- tacted early on to get their input for the project goals and deliverables.\\n\\nIdentifying key stakeholders seems as if it should be fairly easy, but once you get beyond the obvious stakeholders, the process can get difficult. Sometimes stakeholders, even key stakehold- ers, will change throughout the project’s life. The key stakeholders on a project might include the project sponsor, the customer (who might be one and the same as the project sponsor), the project manager, project team members, management personnel, contractors, suppliers, and so on. Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization. One way to uncover stake- holders whom you might not have thought about right at the start is to ask known stakeholders if they’re aware of anyone else that might be impacted by this project. Ask team members if they’re aware of stakeholders who haven’t been identified. Stakeholders might also come to the forefront once you start uncovering some of the goals and deliverables of the project.\\n\\nDon’t forget important stakeholders. That could be a project killer. Leaving out an impor- tant stakeholder, or one whose business processes weren’t considered during the Initiating and Planning processes, could spell disaster for your project.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 99  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nFormulating Scope Definition\\n\\n99\\n\\nUnderstanding Stakeholder Roles\\n\\nIt’s important for the project manager to understand each stakeholder’s role in the project and their role in the organization. Get to know them and their interests. Determine the relationship structure among the various stakeholders. Start cultivating partnerships with these stakeholders now, as it’s going to get pretty cozy during the course of your project. If you establish good working relationships up front and learn a little about their business concerns and needs, it might be easier to negotiate or motivate them later on when you have a pressing issue that needs action. Knowing which stakeholders work well together and which don’t can also help you in the future. One stakeholder may have the authority or influence to twist the arm of another, fig- uratively speaking, of course. Or conversely, you might know of two stakeholders who are like oil and water when put into the same room together. This can be valuable information to keep under your hat for future reference.\\n\\nStakeholders may have a significant amount of influence over the project and its outcomes.\\n\\nUnderstanding the organizational structure, and where the stakeholders fit in that structure, should be your first step in determining the level of influence they have. For example, if Melanie in accounting wields a significant amount of power and influence over the organization, when you need input or decisions from her regarding costs or budgets for the project you better believe that those decisions are not likely going to get overridden. Conversely, if stakeholders with little influence provide direction that you don’t verify, that input could be overridden at a later date by a more powerful stakeholder, causing changes to the project.\\n\\nCommunicating with Stakeholders\\n\\nNow those finely honed communication skills are going to come in handy. We’re just about ready to start documenting the deliverables and requirements of the project. In order to determine the specifics of your project, you’ll want to meet with each of the key stakeholders and document their needs, wants, and expectations. You may want to ask them what business process the project will likely change, enhance, or replace. Perhaps the existing business processes, and the systems that support them, are so old that little documentation exists for them. Determine if there is a critical business need for this project or if it’s a “nice to have,” as we say around our office. What will be the result of this project? Will customer service be improved or sales increased? Find out what pre- vents the stakeholders today from achieving the results they hope the project will accomplish. Ask about the deliverables and how they can be verified and measured. And always ask the stakehold- ers how they will know that the project was completed successfully.\\n\\nOne way to help identify project objectives (which we’ll talk about in the next section) is to talk about what is not included in a project. For example, let’s say you’re working on a highway project to create a new on-ramp from a downtown city street. The goal of this project is to have a new on-ramp constructed and ready for traffic in 18 months from the project start date. Spe- cifically excluded from this project is the demolition of a deteriorating bridge adjacent to the new on-ramp. Make sure you state this in the project scope statement.\\n\\nRemember that the definition of a successful project is one that accomplishes the goals of the project and meets or exceeds stakeholders’ expectations. Understand and document those expectations and you’re off to a good start.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 100  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n100\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2) Developing the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nWriting the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nThe purpose of the project scope statement is to document the project objectives, deliverables, and requirements so that they can be used to direct the project team’s work and as a basis for future project decisions. The scope statement is an agreement between the project and the project customer that states precisely what the work of the project will produce. Simply put, the scope statement tells everyone concerned with the project exactly what they’re going to get when the work is finished.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand that the purpose of the scope statement, according to A Guide to the PMBOK, is to provide all the stakeholders with a foundational understanding of project scope. Also remem- ber that the scope statement defines and progressively elaborates the work of the project and guides the work of the project team during the Executing process and that all change requests will be evaluated against the scope statement. If the change request is outside the bounds of the project scope as documented here, it should be denied.\\n\\nSince the scope statement serves as a baseline for the project, if questions arise or changes are proposed later in the project, they can be compared to what’s documented in the scope state- ment. Making change decisions is easier when the original deliverables and requirements are well documented. You’ll also know what is out of scope for the project simply because the work isn’t documented here (or conversely, deliverables or elements are documented and noted as being specifically out of scope). The criteria outlined in the scope statement will also be used to determine if the project was completed successfully. Hopefully, you’re already seeing the impor- tance of documenting project scope.\\n\\nScope Statement Components\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, the project scope statement should include all of the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject objectives\\n\\nProduct scope description\\n\\nProject deliverables\\n\\nProject requirements\\n\\nProject boundaries\\n\\nProduct acceptance criteria\\n\\nProject constraints\\n\\nProject assumptions\\n\\n3601.book  Page 101  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nWriting the Project Scope Statement\\n\\n101\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nInitial project organization\\n\\nInitial defined risks\\n\\nSchedule milestones\\n\\nFund limitations\\n\\nCost estimates\\n\\nProject configuration management requirements\\n\\nProject specifications\\n\\nApproval requirements\\n\\nIf the details surrounding these are spelled out in other documents, you don’t have to reenter all the information into the scope statement. Simply reference the other document in the scope statement so that readers know where to find it.\\n\\nAre we there yet? Remember in Chapter 2 I promised you we’d get to the details of the preliminary scope statement when we got to this point? We’re there! All of the elements in the preceding list are part of the preliminary scope statement as well as the project scope statement, and we’re going to discuss each one of them. The explanations given here apply to these elements as they pertain to the preliminary and the project scope statements. The difference is that at this point in the project we know more then we did earlier on, so there’ll be more detail here than in the preliminary scope statement. Are you ready? Here we go.\\n\\nSeveral terms are tossed about when we start talking about project scope and sometimes they’re used interchangeably. They are words such as goals, objec- tives, requirements, and deliverables (we’ll get to these last two later in this sec- tion). I’ve referenced the term objectives several times throughout this chapter. Goals and objectives are the purpose for undertaking the project. These are the “what” it is you’re trying to accomplish. They describe the final result of the project. “Increase warehouse space by 17 percent to house the new product line for distribution” and “Improve turnaround times by 25 percent on loan applica- tion services” are both examples of objectives. They state the purpose for the project and the desired end result. Some project managers in practice use the term goals to describe what A Guide to the PMBOK terms objectives. A Guide to the PMBOK doesn’t use the word goals and you won’t find it in its glossary. Be that as it may, we’ll stick with the term it uses, objective. Just keep in mind that you can think of goals and objectives as interchangeable.\\n\\nProject Objectives\\n\\nObjectives are quantifiable criteria used to measure project success. They describe the what it is you’re trying to do, accomplish, or produce. Quantifiable criteria should at least include schedule, cost, and quality measures. You may use business measures or quality targets as well.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 102  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n102\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2) Developing the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nIn the case of project objectives, these elements are used as measurements to determine project satisfaction and successful completion. Costs are typically stated in monetary units (U.S. dol- lars, Euro dollars, and so on) and should be specific. Schedules are typically stated in time mea- surements, and I recommend sticking with a consistent measurement throughout your project. If you use hours, state all schedule-related topics in hours.\\n\\nYou’ve probably seen the acronym SMART regarding goals and objectives a dozen times, but it’s worth repeating. If you follow these principles, you’ll be certain that your objectives meet the “quantifiable criteria” needed to measure success. Objectives should follow the SMART rule:\\n\\nS—Specific Objectives should be specific and written in clear, concise, and understandable terms.\\n\\nM—Measurable Objectives should be measurable.\\n\\nA—Accurate Objectives should be accurate and should describe precisely what’s required.\\n\\nR—Realistic and tangible Objectives that are impossible to accomplish are not realistic and not attainable. Objectives must be centered in reality. For example, it’s not likely you and I will be sending up rocket ships full of chocolate candies to sell to tourists visiting the moon anytime soon.\\n\\nT—Time bound Objectives should have a time frame with an end date assigned to them.\\n\\nLet’s look at some examples of the tangible terms, or quantifiable criteria, we talked about earlier. If your objective is to increase warehouse space, it is better to say the objective is to build four new warehouses. Describing the number of new warehouses to be built is specific and tan- gible. For that reason, you’ll know the project is completed when this objective is met. The objective of offering faster loan approvals might be better stated that the company will provide loan applications over the Internet to increase the speed of the application process by 25 percent by the end of the calendar year. In other words, the purpose for the project is to do something or accomplish something—an objective.\\n\\nLet’s say your company is going to produce a run of holiday beer. Your objective statement might be stated this way: “Beer Buddies, Inc. will produce two million cases of holiday beer to be shipped to our distributors by October 30 at a cost of $1.5 million or less.” The objective cri- teria in this statement are clearly stated, and fulfillment of the project objective can be easily measured. Stakeholders will know the objective is met when the two million cases are produced and shipped by the due date within the budget stated.\\n\\nProduct Scope Description\\n\\nThe product scope description describes the characteristics of the product or service of the project. We talked about this in Chapter 2. If the product scope description is contained in the project charter, you can reference the project charter in the project scope statement. Chances are very good you’ll be using a word processing system of some sort to write these documents. An even bet- ter idea is to copy and paste the information from the project charter into the scope statement. It won’t hurt anything to have it in both places and will make reading the scope statement easier.\\n\\nProject Deliverables\\n\\nDeliverables are measurable outcomes, measurable results, or specific items that must be produced to consider the project or project phase completed. Deliverables, like objectives, must be specific and\\n\\n3601.book  Page 103  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nWriting the Project Scope Statement\\n\\n103\\n\\nverifiable. For example, one of your deliverables might include widgets with a three-inch diameter that will in turn be assembled into the final product. This deliverable, a three-inch-diameter widget, is specific and measurable. However, if the deliverable was not documented or not communicated to the manager or vendor responsible for manufacturing the widgets, there could be a disaster wait- ing to happen. If they deliver two-inch widgets instead of the required three-inch version, it would throw the entire project off schedule or perhaps cause the project to fail. This could be a career-lim- iting move for the project manager, because it’s the project manager’s responsibility to document deliverables and monitor the progress of those deliverables throughout the project. Most projects have multiple deliverables. As in this example, if you are assembling a new product with many parts, each of the parts might be considered independent deliverables.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK describes a project deliverable as either a unique and verifiable prod-\\n\\nuct or result or a service that’s performed. The product or service must be produced or per- formed in order to consider the project complete. The deliverables may also include supplementary outcomes like documentation or project management reports.\\n\\nCritical Success Factors\\n\\nDeliverables and objectives are sometimes referred to as critical success factors. Critical success factors are those elements that must be completed in order for the project to be considered com- plete. For example, if you’re building a bridge, one of the deliverables might be to produce a spe- cific number of trusses that will be used to help support the bridge. Without the trusses, the bridge can’t be completed; in fact, the bridge might not stand without them. The trusses, in this case, are a critical success factor. Not all deliverables are necessarily critical success factors, but many of them will fall into this category and should be documented as such.\\n\\nThe bottom line is this: No matter how well you apply your project skills, if the wrong deliv- erables are produced or the project is managed to the wrong objectives, you will have an unsuc- cessful project on your hands.\\n\\nProject Requirements\\n\\nAfter all the deliverables are identified, the project manager needs to discover and document all of the requirements of the project. Requirements describe the characteristics of the deliverable. They may also describe functionality that the deliverable must have or specific conditions the deliverable must meet in order to satisfy the objective of the project. According to  A Guide to the PMBOK, require- ments are conditions that must be met or criteria that the product or service of the project must possess in order to satisfy the project documents, a contract, a standard, or a specification. Requirements quantify and prioritize the wants, needs, and expectations of the project sponsor and stakeholders.\\n\\nRequirements may include things like dimensions, ease of use, color, specific ingredients, and so on. If we go back to our holiday beer example, you’ll recall that the project objective was to produce a new bottle of beer for the holidays. One of the major deliverables is the cartons to hold the bottles. The requirements for that deliverable may include carton design, photographs that will appear on the carton, color choices, and so on.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 104  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n104\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2) Developing the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nDocumenting All of the Deliverables and Requirements\\n\\nOne of the project manager’s primary functions is to accurately document the deliverables and requirements of the project and then manage the project so that they are produced according to the agreed-upon criteria. Deliverables describe the components of the goals and objectives in a quantifiable way. Requirements are the specifications of the deliverables.\\n\\nThe project manager should use the project charter and preliminary scope statement as a start- ing point for identifying and progressively elaborating project deliverables, but it’s possible that only some of the deliverables will be documented there. Remember that the charter was written by a manager external to the project, and it was the first take at defining the project objectives and deliverables. As the project manager, it’s your job to make certain all the deliv- erables are identified and documented in the project scope statement. That’s because the scope statement (not the project charter) serves as the agreement among stakeholders— including the customer of the project—regarding what project objectives and deliverables will be produced in order to meet and satisfy the requirements of the project.\\n\\nInterview the stakeholders, other project managers, project team members, customers, man- agement staff, industry experts, and any other experts who can help you identify all the deliv- erables of the project. Depending on the size of the project, you might be able to accomplish this in a group setting using simple brainstorming techniques, but large complex projects may have scope statements for each deliverable of the project. Remember that the project scope statement is progressively elaborated into finer detail and is used later on to help decompose the work of the project into smaller tasks and activities.\\n\\nAgain, the project manager needs to pull those communications skills out of her tool bag and\\n\\nuse them to interview stakeholders, customers, project team members, and business process owners about the project requirements. While the project manager is responsible for making certain the requirements are documented, it doesn’t mean this task must be performed by the project manager. The project manager can enlist the help of stakeholders, business analysts, requirements analysts, business process owners, and other team members to conduct the inter- views and document the requirements. The project manager then reviews the requirements and incorporates them into the project documentation and project plan.\\n\\nBusiness process owners are those people who are experts in their particular area of the busi- ness. They are invaluable resources to the project manager. They are usually the midlevel man- agers and line managers who still have their fingers in the day-to-day portion of the business. For example, it takes many experts in various areas to produce and market a great bottle of beer. There are machinists whose specialty is regulating and keeping the stainless steel and cop- per drums in top working order. There are chemists who daily check and adjust the secret for- mulas brewing in the vats. Graphic artists must develop colorful and interesting labels and cartons to attract the attention of those thirsty patrons. And of course, those great TV commer- cials advertising the tasty brew are produced by yet another set of business experts. These are the kinds of people you’ll interview and ask to assist you in identifying requirements.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 105  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nWriting the Project Scope Statement\\n\\n105\\n\\nYou can use the same techniques to determine requirements as you did to determine deliverables. There are several techniques discussed in Chapter 5, “Risk Planning,” that you can use during the Scope Definition process as well to identify deliverables and requirements.\\n\\nGetting the business process owners and stakeholders (who could be one and the same, depending on the project) together in a meeting room and brainstorming the requirements can produce terrific results. Depending on the size of the project, this isn’t always possible, but the idea holds true. Interview your stakeholders and business experts to get at the requirements and then document them in the project scope statement. Remember that, according to A Guide to the PMBOK, the stakeholder analysis (a tool and technique of the Scope Definition process— yes we’re still talking about that process) you performed ultimately turns their needs and expec- tations into prioritized requirements that are documented here in the project scope statement.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand the differences between objectives, deliverables, and requirements. These are first defined during the Initiating processes and are fine-tuned in more detail during the Planning processes.\\n\\nProject Boundaries\\n\\nProject boundaries define what is and what is not included in the work of the project. In this sec- tion of the scope statement, you’ll state what is excluded from scope. The following statement may seem obvious, but I’ll note it anyway: objectives, deliverables, and requirements not specifically included in the project scope statement are explicitly excluded from the project. Stakeholders can- not become confused later and expect that a specific product or deliverable was going to be included in the project when it’s stated here that it will not be produced.\\n\\nProduct Acceptance Criteria\\n\\nProduct acceptance criteria includes the process and the criteria that will be used to determine if the deliverables, and the final product or service of the project, are acceptable and satisfac- tory. Acceptance criteria may include any number of elements, such as quality criteria, fitness for use, and performance criteria.\\n\\nProject Constraints\\n\\nConstraints are anything that either restricts the actions of the project team or dictates the actions of the project team. Constraints put you in a box. (I hope you’re not claustrophobic.) As a project manager, you have to manage to the project constraints, which sometimes requires creativity.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 106  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n106\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2) Developing the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nIn my organization, and I’m sure the same is true in yours, there are far more project requests than we have resources to work on them. In this case, resources are a constraint. You’ll find that a similar phenomenon occurs on individual projects as well. Almost every project you’ll encoun- ter must work within the triple constraint combination of scope, time, and cost. The quality of the project (or the outcomes of the project) is affected by how well these three constraints are managed. Usually one or two of the triple constraints, sometimes all three, apply, which restricts the actions of the project team. You might work on projects where you have an almost unlim- ited budget (don’t we wish!), but time is the limitation. For example, if the president mandated that NASA put a man on Mars by the end of 2008, you’d have a time-constrained project on your hands.\\n\\nOther projects might present the opposite scenario. You have all the time you need to com- plete the project, but the budget is fixed. Still other projects may incorporate two or three of the constraints. Government agencies are notorious for starting projects that have at least two and sometimes all three constraints. For example, new tax laws are passed that impact the computer programs, requiring new programs to calculate and track the tax changes. Typically, a due date is given when the tax law takes effect, and the organization responsible is required to implement the changes with no additions to budget or staff. In other words, they are told to use existing resources to accomplish the objectives of the project, and the specific requirements, or scope, of the project are such that they cannot be changed to try to meet the time deadline.\\n\\nAs a project manager, one of your biggest jobs is to balance the project constraints while meeting or exceeding the expectations of your stakeholders. In most projects, you will usually be faced with balancing only one or two of the triple constraints. For example, if one of the project objectives is to complete the project by the end of the year, the saying goes, “I can give it to you fast or I can give to you cheap, but I can’t give it to you fast and cheap.”\\n\\nConstraints can take on many forms and aren’t limited to time, cost, and scope. Anything that impedes your project team’s ability to perform the work of the project or specifically dic- tates the way the project should be performed is considered a constraint. Governments are a good example here. Let’s say in order to fulfill some of the deliverables of your project you’ll have to purchase a large amount of materials and equipment. Procurement processes can be so cumbersome that ordering supplies for a project may literally add months to the project sched- ule. The procurement process itself becomes a constraint because of the methods and proce- dures you’re required to use to get the materials in house.\\n\\nLet’s take a brief look at some of the common constraints you’ll likely encounter on your\\n\\nfuture projects.\\n\\nTime constraint As I said, time can be a project constraint. This usually comes in the form of an enforced deadline, commonly known as the “make it happen now” scenario. If you are in charge of the company’s holiday bash scheduled for December 10, your project is time con- strained. Once the invitations are out and the hall has been rented, you can’t move the date. All activities on this project are driven by the due date.\\n\\nBudget constraints Budgets are another one of the triple constraints. Budgets limit the project team’s ability to obtain resources and might potentially limit the scope of the project. For exam- ple, component X cannot be part of this project because the budget doesn’t support it.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 107  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nWriting the Project Scope Statement\\n\\n107\\n\\nQuality constraints While A Guide to the PMBOK doesn’t list quality as a constraint, you’ll find in practice that quality can often be a constraint. Quality constraints typically are restricted by the specifications of the product or service. The specifications for those three-inch widgets talked about earlier could be considered a quality constraint. Most of the time, if quality is a constraint, one of the other constraints—time or budget—has to have some give. You can’t pro- duce high quality on a restricted budget and within a tightly restricted time schedule. Of course, there are exceptions, but only in the movies.\\n\\nSchedule constraints Schedule constraints can cause interesting dilemmas for the project man- ager. For example, say you’re the project manager in charge of building a new football stadium in your city. The construction of the stadium will require the use of cranes—and crane opera- tors—at certain times during the project. If crane operators are not available when your project plan calls for them, you’ll have to make schedule adjustments so that the crane operators can come in at the right time.\\n\\nTechnology constraints Technology is a marvelous thing. In fact, how did humans survive prior to the invention of computers and cell phones? Technology certainly can be marvelous, but it can also be a project constraint. For example, your project might require the use of brand- new technology that is still so new it hasn’t been released on a wide-scale basis. One impact might be that the project will take an additional six months because the new technology isn’t ready or hasn’t been tested yet.\\n\\nDirective constraints Directives from management can be constraints as well. Your depart- ment may have specific policies that management requires for the type of work you’re about to undertake. This may add time to the project, so you must consider those policies when identi- fying project constraints. And when you’re performing work on contract, the provisions of the contract can be constraints.\\n\\nConstraints, particularly the triple constraints, can be used to help drive out the objectives and requirements of the project. If it’s difficult to discern which constraint is the primary con- straint, ask the project sponsor something like this, “Ms. Sponsor, if you could only have one of these two alternatives, which would you choose? The project is delivered on the date you’ve stated, or the quality is manufactured to the exact specifications you’ve given.” If Ms. Sponsor replies with the date response, you know your primary constraint is time. If push comes to shove during the project Planning processes, time might have to give because quality cannot.\\n\\nYou’ll want to understand what the primary constraint is on the project. If you assume the pri- mary constraint is budget when in actuality the primary constraint is time, in the immortal words of two-year-olds worldwide, “Uh-oh.” Understanding the constraints and which one carries the most importance will help you out later on in the project Planning process group with things like scope planning, scheduling, estimating, and project plan development. That’s assuming your project gets to the project Planning processes, which brings us to the next topic: project assumptions.\\n\\nProject Assumptions\\n\\nYou’ve probably heard the old saying about the word assume, something about what it makes out of “u” and “me.” In the case of project management, however, throw this old saying out the window, because it’s not true.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 108  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n108\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2) Developing the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nAssumptions, for the purposes of project management, are things you believe to be true. For example, if you’re working on a large construction project, you might make assumptions about the availability of materials. You may assume that concrete, lumber, drywall, and so on are widely available and reasonably priced. You may also assume that finding contract labor is either easy or difficult, depending on the economic times and the availability of labor in your locale. Each project will have its own set of assumptions, and they should be identified, docu- mented, and updated throughout the project.\\n\\nIt’s essential to understand and document the assumptions you’re making, and the assump- tions your stakeholders are making, about the project. It’s also important to find out as many of the assumptions as you can up front. Projects can fail, sometimes after lots of progress has been made, because an important assumption was forgotten or the assumption was incorrect. You will have more assumptions at this point in the project then you did when creating the project charter because more is known about the goals and deliverables of the project. Defining new assumptions and refining old ones are another form of progressive elaboration.\\n\\nLet’s say you make plans to meet your buddy for lunch on Friday at 11:30 at your favorite spot. When Friday rolls around, you assume he’s going to show up, barring any catastrophes between the office and the restaurant. Project assumptions work the same way. For planning purposes, you pre- sume the event or thing you’ve made the assumptions about is true, real, or certain. For example, you might assume that key resources will be available when needed on the project. Document that assumption. If Nancy is the one and only resource who can perform a specific task at a certain point in the project, document your assumption that Nancy will be available and run it by her manager. If Nancy happens to be on a plane for Helsinki at the time you thought she was going to be working on the project, you could have a real problem on your hands.\\n\\nOther assumptions could be factors such as vendor delivery times, product availability, contrac- tor availability, the accuracy of the project plan, the assumption that key project members will per- form adequately, contract signing dates, project start dates, and project phase start dates. This is not an exhaustive list but should get you thinking in the right direction. As you interview your stake- holders, ask them about their assumptions and add them to your list. Use brainstorming exercises with your team and other project participants to come up with additional assumptions.\\n\\nThink about some of the factors you normally take for granted when you’re try- ing to identify assumptions. Many times they’re the elements everyone expects will be available or will behave in a specific way. Think about factors such as key team members’ availability, access to information, access to equip- ment, management support, and vendor reliability.\\n\\nTry to validate your assumptions whenever possible. When discussing assumptions with ven- dors, make them put it in writing. In fact, if the services or goods you’re expecting to be deliv- ered by your suppliers are critical to the project, include a clause in the contract to assure a contingency plan in case your suppliers fail to perform. For example, if you’re expecting 200 PCs to be delivered, configured, and installed by a certain date, require the vendor to pay the cost of rental equipment in the event they can’t deliver on the promised due date.\\n\\nRemember, when assumptions are incorrect or not documented, it could cause problems\\n\\nhalfway through the project and might even be a project killer.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 109  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nWriting the Project Scope Statement\\n\\n109\\n\\nInitial Project Organization\\n\\nIn the initial project organization section, you’ll document who the stakeholders are on the project. We talked about stakeholders earlier in this chapter. You should also document the team members and the way the project will be organized here.\\n\\nInitial Defined Risks\\n\\nRisks pose threats and opportunities to the project. This section should contain a list of all known risks.\\n\\nWe’ll cover risks in much more detail in Chapter 5.\\n\\nSchedule Milestones\\n\\nMilestones are typically points in the project where something significant is achieved or completed. List the major milestones that you know about now in this section of the project scope statement.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about milestones in Chapter 7.\\n\\nFund Limitations\\n\\nFund limitations really refer to the cost constraint. If there are fund limitations (and I’ve never worked on a project where there wasn’t), document them here. Also document any time frames associated with the funding limitations. For example, I often work on projects where funding runs out at the end of the fiscal year. If you haven’t spent the money by then, you’ll no longer have access to it.\\n\\nCost Estimates\\n\\nCost estimates is the section where you list the cost estimates for the project. This should include overall costs for the project and some level of confidence in that estimate.\\n\\nProject Configuration Management Requirements\\n\\nConfiguration management describes the characteristics of the product of the project and ensures that the description is accurate and complete.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about configuration management in Chapter 9.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 110  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n110\\n\\nChapter 3 (cid:2) Developing the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nProject Specifications\\n\\nIf there are specification documents that the project should comply with, for example, industry specifications or technology specifications—note that in the project specifications section.\\n\\nApproval Requirements\\n\\nApproval requirements refer to how the objectives, deliverables, project management docu- ments, and other outcomes and results of the project will be approved. This is different than product acceptance criteria—that element describes how the product itself will be approved, whereas this element describes the requirements that must be met in order to approve the objec- tives and so on. An example product acceptance criteria might be “all widgets must measure three inches.” A deliverable approval requirement might be that the director of sales must approve a prototype before the project can proceed. This section may also contain the process and approval requirements of the project scope statement.\\n\\nApproving and Publishing the Project Scope Statement\\n\\nJust like the project charter, the project scope statement should be approved, agreed upon, pub- lished, and distributed to the stakeholders, key management personnel, and project team mem- bers. You can accomplish this with a formal sign-off procedure that’s documented as part of the “approval requirements” section of the scope statement. When stakeholders sign off and agree to the scope statement, they’re agreeing to the deliverables and requirements of the project. And, as with the project charter, their agreement and endorsement of the project requirements and deliverables will likely sustain their participation and cooperation throughout the rest of the project. That doesn’t mean they’ll agree to everything as the project progresses, but it does mean the stakeholders are informed and will likely remain active project participants.\\n\\nUpdating the Project Scope Management Plan\\n\\nTwo outputs of the Scope Definition process remain. Those outputs are requested changes and project scope management plan updates. When you’re in the midst of defining deliverables and requirements, you’ll often find that changes to the original objectives and requirements will occur. These requested changes, once reviewed and approved, will change the scope of the project. If the project scope statement has been approved and published, you’ll need to make changes to it and notify stakeholders that changes have been made.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about change control and change request processes in Chapter 9.\\n\\nApproved changes may also impact the project scope management plan or some of the sub- sidiary plans that make up this plan. Make certain you update this plan as a result of the changes made during the Scope Definition process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 111  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nWriting the Project Scope Statement\\n\\n111\\n\\nMountain Streams Services\\n\\nMaria Sanchez is the CEO of Mountain Streams Services.

You’re ready to start writing the project scope statement and have a question or two for Dirk. You knock on his door and he invites you in.\\n\\n“Shoot.”\\n\\n“I’m ready to define the deliverables and requirements for this project. I want to make sure I get the right folks involved in the meeting. Who are key stakeholders you recommend I speak with?”\\n\\n“There are a few people I can think of right off that you don’t want to miss. There’s Jake Peter- son over in Facilities. He’s in charge of store furnishings, shelving, things like that—any sup- plies for the stores that aren’t retail products. He can help out with store build-outs, too. He supervised our last eight stores and did a terrific job.”\\n\\n“Anyone else?” you ask.\\n\\n“You should also talk to Jill Overstreet, the director in charge of retail products. She can help with the initial store stocking, and once the store is open, her group will take over the ongoing operations. All the district managers report to Jill.”\\n\\nYou thank Dirk and tell him you’re going to contact Jake and Jill and set up a brainstorming ses- sion to determine requirements.\\n\\nA few days later.\\n\\nYou review your notes and reread the first draft of the project scope statement you’ve prepared for the Kitchen Heaven retail store before looking for Dirk. After your meetings with the stake- holders, you were better able to refine the project objectives and deliverables.\\n\\n“Dirk, I’m glad I caught you. I’d like to go over the project scope statement with you before I give it to the stakeholders. Do you have a few minutes?”\\n\\n“Sure,” Dirk says to you. “Let’s have it.”\\n\\n“The project objective is to open the 50th Kitchen Heaven store in Colorado Springs by Febru- ary 1. When I met with Jake, he confirmed it takes 120 days to do the store build-out. That includes having the shelves set up and in place, ready to stock with inventory.”\\n\\nDirk asks if Jake told you about his store location idea.\\n\\n“Yes, Jake gave me a contact name of the leasing agent, and I’ve left her a voice mail. The sooner we can get that lease signed, the better. It takes Jake 120 days to do the build-out, and Jill said she needs 2 weeks lead time to order the initial inventory and stock the shelves. That puts us pretty close to our February 1st deadline, counting the time to get the lease papers signed.”\\n\\n“Sounds good so far,” Dirk replies. “What else?”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 113  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nWriting the Project Scope Statement\\n\\n113\\n\\n“I’ve included an updated description of the products and services the new store will offer, based on the documentation that was written from the last store opening. Jill reviewed the updates to the description, so we should be in the clear there. The store will include some new lines that we’ve decided to take on—cookware from famous chefs, that kind of thing.\\n\\n“Jake has already made contact with a general contractor in Colorado Springs, and he is ready to roll once we’ve signed the lease.\\n\\n“One more thing, Dirk. Since we’re including the big bash at grand opening as part of the deliv- erables, I talked to some of your folks in marketing to get some ideas. They are thinking we should have some great giveaways as door prizes and that we will want to cater in the food. They also thought having some live cooking demonstrations with some local chefs would be a good attraction.”\\n\\n“Sounds like you’re on the right track. So what’s next?” Dirk asks.\\n\\n“Once you approve the scope statement, I’d like to send a copy to the stakeholders. My next step is to break down the deliverables and requirements I’ve documented here into activities so we can get rolling on the work of the project.”\\n\\nProject Case Study Checklist\\n\\nStakeholder analysis: Jake Peterson and Jill Overstreet interviewed.

The purpose of this plan is to define how the project is executed, how it’s monitored and controlled, and how it’s closed\\n\\nScope Planning is where you produce the scope management plan, which is a planning tool that documents how the project team will go about defining project scope, how the work break- down structure will be developed, how changes to scope will be controlled, and how project scope will be verified\\n\\nThe scope statement is produced during the Scope Definition process. It describes the project\\n\\nobjectives, deliverables, and requirements. The scope statement forms a baseline you’ll use to weigh future project decisions, most particularly change requests. The scope statement contains a list of project deliverables that will be used in future Planning processes. Measurement criteria for project objectives are agreed upon by the stakeholders and project manager. These criteria are associated with the deliverables and documented in the scope statement to track project progress. The deliverables, requirements, and measurement criteria should be spelled out clearly and\\n\\nconcisely in the scope statement to avoid any misunderstandings later in the project. Formal acceptance of the scope statement is required by the stakeholders and project manager. Accep- tance is usually accompanied by sign-offs on the document indicating that it has been read and that the signing party agrees with the deliverables and requirements of the project.\\n\\nThe project scope statement contains many elements, including objectives, deliverables, requirements, boundary descriptions (exclusions from scope), constraints, assumptions, prod- uct acceptance criteria, project organization, initial risks, schedule milestones, fund limitations, configuration management requirements, cost estimates, project specifications, and approval requirements.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 115  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\n115\\n\\nConstraints restrict or dictate the actions of the project team.

We’ll\\n\\naccomplish this task in the Create WBS process. The WBS defines the scope of the project and breaks the work down into components that can be scheduled and estimated and easily mon- itored and controlled.\\n\\nNext we’ll talk about how project information is documented and communicated. We’ve talked a lot about documentation so far, and we will discuss it more in this chapter. Documen- tation is something you will do throughout the remainder of the project, and the Communica- tions Planning process details how to collect information, how to store it, and when and how to distribute it to stakeholders.\\n\\nWe’ll end this chapter by defining the quality plan in the Quality Planning process. This pro- cess focuses on determining the quality standards that are necessary for the project and docu- menting how we’ll go about meeting them.\\n\\nCreating the Work Breakdown Structure\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nwork breakdown structure (WBS).\\n\\nHave you ever mapped out a family tree? In the Create WBS process, we’ll construct something It maps out the deliverables of the project with like it called a subdeliverables and other components stemming from each major deliverable in a tree or chart describes a WBS as “a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decom- format. position of the work to be executed by the project team, to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS defines the total scope of the project.” Simply put, a WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy that defines the work of the project and only the work of the project. Like the scope statement, the WBS serves as a foundational agreement among the stakeholders and project team members regarding project scope.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe subdividing of deliverables into smaller components is the purpose of the Create WBS pro- cess. calls this decomposition, which is also a tool and technique of this process.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\n3601.book  Page 127  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCreating the Work Breakdown Structure\\n\\n127\\n\\nThe WBS will be used throughout many of the remaining Planning processes and is an impor- tant part of project planning. As you probably have concluded, everything we’ve done so far builds on the previous step. The project charter and preliminary scope statement outline the project goals and major deliverables. The project scope statement further refines these deliver- ables into an exhaustive list and documents the requirements of the deliverables. Now that com- prehensive list of deliverables produced in the project scope statement is going to be used to build the framework of the WBS.\\n\\nThe importance and accuracy of the work you’ve done up to this point can’t be stressed enough. Your WBS will only be as accurate as your list of deliverables. The deliverables will become the groupings that will form the higher levels of the WBS from which activities will be derived later in the Planning processes.\\n\\nThe WBS should detail the full scope of work needed to complete the project. This break- down will smooth the way for estimating project cost and time, scheduling resources, and deter- mining quality controls later in the Planning processes. Project progress will be based on the estimates and measurements assigned to the WBS segments. So again, accuracy and complete- ness are required when composing your WBS.\\n\\nBefore we begin constructing the WBS, we’ll need to gather and review some important\\n\\nproject documents. We’ll look at those next.\\n\\nGathering the WBS Inputs\\n\\nThe inputs to the Create WBS process aren’t new. They are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nProject scope management plan\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\nThe important thing to note about the inputs to this process is that the approved project scope statement is the document you will use to define and organize the work of the project in the WBS. Make certain you’re using the most current version of the scope statement. And note also that the WBS, just like the project scope statement, contains the work of the project and only the work of the project.\\n\\nDecomposing the Deliverables\\n\\nThere are two tools and techniques for the Create WBS process. The first is the work breakdown structure templates. Many organizations and application areas (industries) have WBS templates they use for their projects. Keep in mind that you may use a WBS from a previous project as a template for your current project also. If you work in the same organization, and the same department within the organization, you’ll often find yourself working on the same types of\\n\\n3601.book  Page 128  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n128\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nprojects. WBS templates lend themselves well to this situation because even though a project is unique, it’s similar to projects you’ve worked on in the past and probably has similar life cycle phases. Check with your PMO as they may also have WBS templates.\\n\\nThe next tool and technique is called\\n\\nThis technique involves breaking down decomposition. the deliverables into smaller, more manageable components of work. The idea here is to break down the deliverables to a point where you can easily plan, execute, monitor and control, and close out the project deliverables. Decomposition typically pertains to breaking deliverables down into smaller deliverables, or component deliverables, where each level of the WBS (or each level of decomposition) is a more detailed definition of the level above it.\\n\\nThis breaking-down or decomposing process will accomplish several things for you, one of which is improving estimates. It’s easier to estimate the costs, time, and resources needed for individual work components than it is to estimate them for a whole body of work or deliverable. Using smaller components also makes it easier to assign performance measures and controls. These give you a baseline to compare against throughout the project or phase. And finally, assigning resources and responsibility for the components of work makes better sense because several resources with different skills might be needed to complete one deliverable. Breaking them down assures that an assignment, and the responsibility for that assignment, goes to the proper parties.\\n\\nAccording to\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\n, decomposition is a five-step process:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nStep one involves identifying all the major project deliverables and related work. to the PMBOK the expert judgment technique to analyze the project scope statement.\\n\\nA Guide makes a point of noting that the major deliverables are identified by using\\n\\n2.\\n\\nStep two involves organizing the work of the project and determining the WBS structure.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about this in the next section, “Constructing the WBS.”\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nStep three involves decomposing the WBS levels into lower-level WBS com- ponents, like the deliverables and requirements, should be defined in tangible, verifiable terms so that performance and successful completion (or delivery) are easily measured and verified. Each component must clearly describe the product, service, or result in verifiable terms, and it must be assigned to a unit in the organization that will take responsibility for completing the work and making certain of its accuracy.\\n\\ncomponents.\\n\\nStep four is a process where you assign identification codes or numbers to each of the WBS components.\\n\\nStep five is a verification step. Examine the decomposition to determine if all the compo- nents are clear and complete. Determine if each component listed is absolutely necessary to fulfill the requirements of the deliverable and verify that the decomposition is sufficient enough to describe the work.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 129  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCreating the Work Breakdown Structure\\n\\n129\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about the process in step 4 in the section titled “Unique WBS Identifiers” later in this chapter.\\n\\nThe components you’ve identified can now be plugged into the WBS. This all sounds like a lot of work. I won’t kid you—it is, but it’s essential to project success. If you don’t perform the WBS process adequately and accurately, you might end up setting yourself up for a failed project at worst or for lots of project changes, delayed schedules, and increased costs at best, not to mention all those team members who’ll throw up their hands when you go back to them for the third or fourth time to ask that they redo work they’ve already completed. I know you won’t let this happen, so let’s move on to constructing the WBS.\\n\\nThere are several outputs of the Create WBS process, one of which is the WBS itself. We’ll\\n\\nlook at the specifics of how to create the WBS next.\\n\\nConstructing the WBS\\n\\nThere is no “right” way to construct a WBS. In practice, the chart structure is used quite often. (This structure resembles an organization chart with different levels of detail.) But a WBS could be composed in outline form as well. The choice is yours. We’ll look at both ways shortly, along with some figures that depict the different levels of a WBS.\\n\\nAccording the\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nthere are also several ways you can organize\\n\\nthe WBS:\\n\\nThe major deliverables of the project are used as the first Major deliverables and subprojects level of decomposition in this structure. If you’re opening a new store, for example, the deliv- erables might include determining location, store build-out, furnishings, product, and so on. We’ll talk about subprojects under the next heading.\\n\\nAnother way to organize the work is by sub- Subproject executed outside the project team projects. Perhaps you’re building out an existing highway and there are several subprojects involved. Some of your first level of decomposition may include these subprojects: demolition, design, bridgework, and paving. Each of the subprojects managers will develop a WBS for their subproject that details the work required for that deliverable. When subproject work is involved, often times the subproject work is contracted out. In our example, if we contracted out the bridgework deliverable, this subproject requires its own WBS, which the seller (the bridgework subcontractor) is responsible for creating as part of the contract and contract work.\\n\\nMany projects are structured or organized by project phases. For example, let’s\\n\\nProject phases say you work in the construction industry. The project phases used in your industry might include project initiation, planning, design, build, inspection, and turnover. A feasibility study might be a deliverable under the project initiation phase, blueprints might be a deliverable under the planning phase, and so on. Each phase listed here would be the first level of decomposition (that is, the first level of the WBS) and their deliverables would be the next level and so on.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 130  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n130\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nThis approach combines some or all of the methods we’ve talked\\n\\nCombination approach about. You may use project phases and major deliverables together as the first level of decom- position. Or you could have subprojects listed with major deliverables. You can use this approach in other levels of the WBS structure as well, not just the first level.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at some example WBS structures next.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Various WBS Levels\\n\\nAlthough the project manager is free to determine the number of levels in the WBS based on the complexity of the project, all WBS structures start out with the project itself. Some WBS structures show the project as level one. Others show the level under the project, or the first notes that level one is the first level A Guide to the PMBOK level of decomposition, as level one. of decomposition, so we’ll follow that example here.\\n\\nThe first level of decomposition may be the deliverables, phases, or subprojects as we talked about earlier. The levels that follow show more and more detail and may include more deliv- in the erables, followed by requirements, and so on. Each of these breakouts is called a WBS. The lowest level of any WBS is called the work package level. (We’ll talk more about this in “Defining Work Packages” later in this chapter). The goal is to construct the WBS to the work package level where we can easily and reliably estimate cost and schedule dates.\\n\\nlevel\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nRemember that each descending level of the WBS is a more detailed description of the project deliverables than the level above it. Each component of the WBS should be defined clearly and completely and should describe how the work of the project will be performed and controlled.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nThere is some controversy among project managers over whether activities should be listed on the WBS. There isn’t a rule in regard- ing this; it’s up to the project manager to determine how far to break the deliv- erables down and whether to include activities. In practice, I often include activities on my work breakdown structure for small projects as it facilitates other Planning processes later on. In this case, the activities are the work pack- age level. However, you should realize that large, complex projects will not likely list activities on the WBS. And for the exam, remember that you will decompose activities during the Activity Definition process that we’ll talk about part of the WBS. in Chapter 6, “Resource Planning,” and that activities are\\n\\nnot\\n\\nThe easiest way to describe the steps for creating a WBS is with an example. Let’s suppose you work for a software company that publishes children’s games. You’re the project manager for the new Billy Bob’s Bassoon game, which teaches children about music, musical rhythm, and\\n\\n3601.book  Page 131  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCreating the Work Breakdown Structure\\n\\n131\\n\\nbeginning sight reading. The first box on the WBS is the project name; it appears at the top of the WBS, as shown in Figure 4.1.\\n\\nThe next level is the first level of decomposition and should describe the major deliverables\\n\\nfor the project. In this example, some of the deliverables might be requirements definition, design specifications, and programming. This isn’t an exhaustive list of deliverables; in practice, you would go on to place all of your major deliverables into the WBS as level one content. For illustration purposes, just look at a slice of the WBS for this project. Figure 4.1 shows the WBS with level one detail added.\\n\\nF I G U R E 4 . 1\\n\\nWBS level one\\n\\nBilly Bob's Bassoon\\n\\nWBS Level One\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nSpecifications\\n\\nProgram\\n\\nModules\\n\\nLevel two content might be the component deliverables that are further broken out from the major deliverables of level one, or it might be requirements or activities that contribute to the deliverable. The Billy Bob’s Bassoon example shows further deliverables as level two content. See Figure 4.2 for an illustration of the WBS so far.\\n\\nF I G U R E 4 . 2\\n\\nWBS levels one and two\\n\\nBilly Bob's Bassoon\\n\\nWBS Level One\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nSpecifications\\n\\nProgram\\n\\nModules\\n\\nWBS Level Two\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nGame\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nCode\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nTesting\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nThe goal here is to eventually break the work out to the point where responsibility and accountability for each work package can be assigned to an organizational unit or a team of people. I’ve decomposed this WBS to the activity level because it’s a small project. An easy way\\n\\n3601.book  Page 132  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n132\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nto differentiate between deliverables and activities in the WBS is to use nouns as the deliverable descriptors and verbs as activity descriptors. Reaching way back to my grade school English, I recall that a noun is a person, place, or thing. In this example, the deliverables in level one and level two are described using nouns. The activity level, level three in the example in Figure 4.3, design, is described using verbs, or action words. Some of the verbs used in level three are There are many more activities that would go with these deliverables, but for the and sake of illustration, we’ve listed just a few for each deliverable to give you an idea of how the WBS is constructed.\\n\\ndetermine.\\n\\ndefine,\\n\\nF I G U R E 4 . 3\\n\\nWBS levels one, two, and three\\n\\nBilly Bob's Bassoon\\n\\nWBS Level One\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nSpecifications\\n\\nProgram\\n\\nModules\\n\\nWBS Level Two\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nGame\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nCode\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nTesting\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nWBS Level Three\\n\\nDefine\\n\\nCharacters\\n\\nDetermine\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nScreens\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nSpeakers\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nModule 1\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nUnit Test\\n\\nDefine\\n\\nInstruments\\n\\nDefine\\n\\nSystems\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nUse\\n\\nCases\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nCase\\n\\nProgram\\n\\nModule 1\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nSystem Test\\n\\nYou can see from these illustrations how a poor scope definition or inadequate list of deliv- erables will lead to a poorly constructed WBS. Not only will this make the WBS look sickly, but the project itself will suffer and might even succumb to the dreaded premature project demise. The final cost of the project will be higher than estimated, and lots of rework (translate as late nights and weekends) will be needed to account for the missing work not listed on the WBS. You can construct a good WBS and maintain a healthy project by taking the time to document all the deliverables during the Scope Definition process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 133  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCreating the Work Breakdown Structure\\n\\n133\\n\\nWBS Templates\\n\\nDon’t forget that work breakdown structures can be constructed using WBS templates or the WBS from a similar completed project. A bit earlier, we mentioned that WBS templates are a tool and technique of the Create WBS process. While every project is unique, many companies and industries perform the same kind of projects over and over. The deliverables are similar from project to project, and they generally follow a consistent path. The WBS templates can be used in a case like this as a tool to simplify the WBS process, saving the project manager time.\\n\\nLarge, complex projects are often composed of several subprojects that collec- tively make up the main project. The WBS for a project such as this would show the subprojects as level one detail. These subprojects’ major deliverables would then be listed as level two content, perhaps more deliverables as level three, and so on.\\n\\nDon’t get too carried away when creating a WBS. The object is to define the work of the project so you can easily plan, manage, and monitor and control the work. But, you don’t want to take this too far. If you decompose the work to the point that you’re showing every minute detail, you’ve ventured into inefficiency and will find it more difficult to plan and manage. In addition, you’re potentially stifling the creativity of the people working on the project because everything is so narrowly defined.\\n\\nSometimes, particularly when working on large projects that consist of several subprojects, some of the subprojects may not be scheduled to be worked on until a future date. Obviously, it makes sense to develop the WBS in detail at that future date when the deliverables and sub- rolling wave projects are better known and more details are available. This technique is called The idea behind this technique is that you elaborate the work of the project to the planning. level of detail you know about at the time. If a subproject or deliverable is scheduled sometime in the future, the only component that may appear on the WBS today is the subproject itself. As you get closer to the subproject, you’ll elaborate the details of the subproject and record them on the WBS.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand that rolling wave planning is a process of elaborating deliverables, project phases, or subprojects in the WBS to differing levels of decomposition depending on the expected date of the work. Work in the near term is elaborated in more detail than work to performed in the future.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 134  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n134\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nUnique WBS Identifiers\\n\\nA Each element at each level of the WBS is generally assigned a unique identifier according to This unique identifier is typically a number, and it’s used to sum and Guide to the PMBOK. track the costs, schedule, and resources associated with the WBS elements. These numbers are usually associated with the corporation’s chart of accounts, which is used to track costs by cat- The unique egory. Collectively, these numeric identifiers are known as the identifiers for the requirements definition branch of the WBS might look something like this:\\n\\ncode of accounts.\\n\\n10 Requirements Definition\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Game Requirements\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Define Characters\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Define Instruments\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Software Requirements\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Determine Language\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Define Systems\\n\\nDefining Work Packages\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, the project manager is free to determine the number of levels in the WBS based on the complexity of the project. You need to include enough levels to accurately estimate project time and costs but not so many levels that it’s difficult to distinguish between the components. Regardless of the number of levels in a WBS, the lowest level in a WBS is called a\\n\\nwork package.\\n\\nWork packages are the components that can be easily assigned to one person, or team of peo- ple, with clear accountability and responsibility for completing the assignment. Assignments are easily made at the work package level; however, assignments can be made at any level in the WBS, as in the Lincoln Street office building scenario. The work package level is where time esti- mates, cost estimates, and resource estimates are determined.\\n\\nWork package levels on large projects can represent subprojects that are further decomposed into their own work breakdown structures. They may also consist of project work that will be completed by a vendor, another organization, or another department in your organization. If you’re giving project work to another department in your organization, you’ll assign the work packages to individual managers, who will in turn break them down into activities during the Activity Definition process later in the Planning process group.\\n\\nWork packages may be assigned to vendors or others external to the organization. For exam- ple, perhaps one of the deliverables in your project is special packaging and a vendor is respon- sible for completing this work. The vendor will likely treat this deliverable as a project within their own organization and construct their own WBS with several levels of decomposition. However, for your project, it’s a deliverable listed at the work package level of the WBS.\\n\\nThis may seem self-evident, but work elements not shown on the WBS are not included in the project. The same holds true for the project scope statement— if the deliverable isn’t noted there, it isn’t part of the project.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 135  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCreating the Work Breakdown Structure\\n\\n135\\n\\nThe Lincoln Street Office Building\\n\\nFlagship International has just purchased a new building to house its growing staff. The folks at Flagship consider themselves very lucky to have won the bid on the property located in a prime section of the downtown area. The building is a historic building and is in need of some repairs and upgrades to make it suitable for office space. Constructing the renovations will require special handling and care as outlined in the\\n\\nHistorical Society Building Revisions Guide.\\n\\nAlfredo Martini is the project manager assigned to the renovation project. Alfredo has already gathered the deliverables for this project. In so doing, he’s discovered that he will not be able to manage all the work himself. He will need several subproject managers working on individ- ual deliverables, all reporting to him. Alfredo calls a meeting with the other project managers to deliver the WBS. Let’s eavesdrop on the meeting.\\n\\n“As you all know, we’re planning to move into the Lincoln Street building by November 1st. There is quite a bit of work to do between now and then, and I’m enlisting each of you to man- age a segment of this project. Take a look at this WBS.”\\n\\nA portion of the WBS Alfredo constructed looks like this:\\n\\nLincoln Street Building Renovation\\n\\n1.0 Facility Safety\\n\\n1.1 Sprinkler System\\n\\n1.2 Elevators\\n\\n1.3 Emergency Evacuation Plans\\n\\n2.0 Asbestos Abatement\\n\\n2.1 Inspection and Identification\\n\\n2.2 Plans for Removal\\n\\n3.0 Office Space\\n\\n3.1 Building Floor Plans\\n\\n3.2 Plans for Office Space Allocation\\n\\n3.3 Plans for Break Room Facilities\\n\\n3.4 Plans for Employee Workout Room\\n\\n3601.book  Page 136  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n136\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nAlfredo continues, “I’m going to manage the Facility Safety project. Adrian, I’d like you to take the Asbestos Abatement project, and Orlando, you’re responsible for the Office Space project.”\\n\\n“Alfredo,” Adrian says. “Asbestos abatement is going to take contractors and specialized equipment. We don’t have staff to do these tasks.”\\n\\n“I understand. You’ll need to take charge of securing the contractor to handle this. Your respon- sibility will be to manage the contractor and keep them on schedule,” Alfredo answers.\\n\\nOrlando reminds Alfredo that he’s missed a deliverable on the WBS. “Part of the Office Space project needs to include the network communications and telecommunications equipment rooms. I don’t see that on here.”\\n\\n“Good point, Orlando,” Alfredo says. “The level two and three elements of this WBS are not complete. Each of you has been assigned to the subproject level, level one. Your first assign- ment is to meet back here in two weeks with a WBS for your subproject. And I’d like to see some ideas about the staff assignments you’d make at the work package level and how long you think these components will take. We’ll refine those after we meet next.”\\n\\nOther Breakdown Structures\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nOne point that makes that I want you to be aware of is that you should not confuse the WBS with other types of breakdown structures. I’m not sure why you would confuse them, but the team who wrote the guide makes a point of telling you about it, so you should be aware of it for the exam. Here are the other structures they point out that we’ll see as we proceed through the remaining project processes:\\n\\nOrganization breakdown structure (OBS) This is an organization chart that describes the hier- archical nature of the organization, what departments exist, and who reports to whom. It can be used to identify the organizational units responsible for the work package levels of the WBS.\\n\\nBill of materials (BOM) the components needed to produce the product.\\n\\nBOMs are typically used in the manufacturing industry and identify\\n\\nRisk breakdown structure (RBS) project arranged by risk category.\\n\\nThis is a hierarchical picture of the risks identified on the\\n\\nResource breakdown structure (RBS) arranged by type, that will work on the project.\\n\\nThis is a hierarchical description of the resources,\\n\\nNow we’ll move on to the remaining outputs of the Create WBS process.\\n\\nCreate WBS Process Outputs\\n\\nThere are six outputs of the Create WBS process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement updates\\n\\nWork breakdown structure\\n\\n3601.book  Page 137  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCreating the Work Breakdown Structure\\n\\n137\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nWBS dictionary\\n\\nScope baseline\\n\\nProject scope management plan updates\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nWe’ve covered the WBS in detail already. Updates to the scope statement and scope manage- ment plan may come about as a result of approved changes that occur when you’re creating the WBS. You can see from the examples we’ve walked through in this chapter how new deliverables or requirements may surface as a result of working on the WBS. These requested changes (the last output here) should be reviewed and either approved or denied using your change control pro- cesses. (We’ll talk about that in Chapter 9, “Measuring and Controlling Project Performance.”) The approved changes should be noted in the project scope statement and the project management plan should be updated to reflect the new approved project scope statement.\\n\\nWe’ll look at the remaining outputs next.\\n\\nWBS Dictionary\\n\\nWBS dictionary\\n\\nThe\\n\\nGuide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nponent of the WBS:\\n\\nis where work component descriptions are documented.

We’ll use the work package level defined in the sidebar “The Lincoln Street Office Building” earlier called Inspec- tion and Identification. The WBS dictionary entry for this might look like the following:\\n\\n2.1 Inspection and Identification\\n\\nStatement of work: Inspect the building for asbestos and identify all areas where it’s found. Update the plan for removal (WBS 2.2) with each location identified.\\n\\nResponsible organization: Adrian in Facilities will hire and oversee a contractor to perform this work.\\n\\nSchedule milestones: Inspection and identification to start after contractor is identified and hired (no later than July 1.) Work to be completed no later than Sep 15.\\n\\nContract information: Two contractors have been identified as qualified and experienced in this type of work.

This is an impor- tant concept you should know for this output. The scope baseline for the project is the approved project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. (You’ll recall from Chapter 3 that the project scope statement serves as a baseline for future project decisions because it helps the team determine whether requested changes are inside or outside of scope.) In other words, these documents together describe in detail all of the work of the project. From these documents, you’ll document schedules, assign resources, and monitor and control the work of the project according to what’s described here.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe scope baseline is defined as the detailed project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. Understand this concept for the exam.\\n\\nIf the WBS is constructed well, you’ve given yourself a huge helping hand with the remaining Planning processes. The completion of many of the remaining processes depend on the project scope statement and WBS to be accurate and complete. In Chapter 6, for example, we’ll use the work packages created here to further elaborate the work into activities. From there, costs can be estimated, schedules can be developed, and so on. Before we get there though, we’re going to take a little breather and look at some of the other Planning processes important to your project. Don’t forget about the WBS! We’re going to come back to this in the later planning chapters of this book.\\n\\nCommunicating the Plan\\n\\nWe’ve talked a good deal about documentation so far, and this topic will continue to come up throughout the remainder of the book. Keeping good documentation should become the motto of all good project managers. “Is that documented?” should be an ever-present question on the mind of the project manager. Documentation can save your bacon, so to speak, later in the project. Documentation is only one side of the equation though—communication is the other. You and your stakeholders need to know who gets what information and when.\\n\\nThe Communications Planning process involves determining the communication needs of the stakeholders by defining the types of information needed, the format for communicating the information, how often it’s distributed, and who prepares it. All of this is documented in the communications management plan, which is the only output of this process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 139  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCommunicating the Plan\\n\\n139\\n\\nPop quiz: Do you remember where else the communications management plan belongs? I’ll give you the answer later in the section “Communications Man- agement Plan.”\\n\\nCommunications Planning Inputs\\n\\nThe inputs to the Communications Planning process will look very familiar to you. They are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nConstraints and assumptions elements of the project management plan\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK notes that all the elements described in the enterprise environmental factors and in the organizational process assets are inputs to this process. However, special note is made of the lessons learned and historical information elements of the organizational process assets input. Information you learn as you’re progressing through the project is documented as lessons learned. This information is helpful for future projects of similar scope and complexity. Historical information is also useful to review when starting the Communications Planning pro- cess. Either of these documents may contain information about communication decisions on past projects and their results. Why reinvent the wheel? If something didn’t work well on a past project, you’d want to know that before implementing that procedure on this project, so review past project documentation.\\n\\nThe project scope management plan (we talked about this in Chapter 3) provides a common\\n\\nunderstanding of project scope among the stakeholders and serves a basis for future project decisions. (I’m sure you have this definition memorized by now—that’s good.) Since you per- formed stakeholder analysis as part of the Scope Definition process (which produced the project scope statement as an output that became an input to this process), you should review the stake- holder analysis and refresh your memory on their communication needs.\\n\\nThe project management plan defines how the subsidiary plans will be defined and integrated into the overall project management plan. As such, it’s rich with constraints and assumptions that you should review as they pertain to stakeholder communication needs.\\n\\nTools and Techniques for Communications Planning\\n\\nThe Communications Planning process concerns defining the types of information you’re going to deliver, to whom, and when and then documenting this. There are two tools and techniques in this process to help determine these elements. They are communications requirements anal- ysis and communications technology. We’ll look at both of these next.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 140  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n140\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2) Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nRequirements Analysis\\n\\nCommunications requirements analysis involves analyzing and determining the communication needs of the project stakeholders. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, there are several sources of information you can examine to help determine these needs, including the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCompany and departmental organizational charts\\n\\nStakeholder relationships\\n\\n(cid:2) Other departments and business units involved on the project\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe number of resources involved on the project and where they’re located in relation to project activities\\n\\nExternal needs that organizations like the media, government, or industry groups may have that require communication updates\\n\\nCommunication needs that are internal to the organization\\n\\nStakeholder information (a lot of this was documented during stakeholder analysis)\\n\\nThis tool and technique requires an analysis of the items in the preceding list to make certain you’re communicating information that’s valuable to the stakeholders. Communicating valuable informa- tion doesn’t mean you always paint a rosy picture. Communications to stakeholders may consist of either good or bad news—the point is that you don’t want to bury stakeholders in too much infor- mation but give them enough so that they’re informed and can make appropriate decisions.\\n\\nProject communication will always involve more than one person, even on the tiniest of projects. As such, communication network models have been devised to try to explain the rela- tionships between people and the number or type of interactions needed between project par- ticipants. What you need to remember for the exam is that network models consist of nodes with lines connecting the nodes that indicate the number of communication channels, also known as lines of communication. Figure 4.4 shows an example of a network communication model with six channels of communication.\\n\\nThe nodes are the participants, and the lines show the connection between them all. You’ll\\n\\nneed to know how to calculate the number of communication channels when you take the exam. You could draw them out as in this example and count up the lines, but there’s an easier way. The formula for calculating the lines of communication is as follows:\\n\\n(number of participants × (number of participants less one)) divided by two Here’s the calculation in mathematical terms:\\n\\nn (n – 1) ÷ 2\\n\\nFigure 4.4 shows six participants, so let’s plug that into the formula to determine the lines\\n\\nof communication:\\n\\n6 (6 – 1) ÷ 2 = 15\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nI recommend you memorize the communications channel formula before taking the exam.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 141  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCommunicating the Plan\\n\\n141\\n\\nF I G U R E 4 . 4\\n\\nNetwork communication model\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n1\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\nNodes = participants Lines = lines of communication between participants\\n\\nCommunications Technology\\n\\nThe second tool and technique of this process is communications technology. This examines the methods (or technology) used to communicate the information to, from, and among the stake- holders. Methods of communicating can take many forms, such as written, spoken, e-mail, for- mal status reports, meetings, online databases, online schedules, and so on. This tool and technique examines the technology elements that may affect project communications. You should consider several factors before deciding what methods you’ll choose to transfer infor- mation. The timing of the information exchange or need for updates is the first factor. The avail- ability of the technology you’re planning on using to communicate project information is important as well. Do you need to procure new technology or systems, or are there systems already in place that will work? Staff experience with the technology is another factor. Are the project team members and stakeholders experienced at using this technology, or will you need to train them? Finally, consider the duration of the project and the project environment. Will the technology you’re choosing work throughout the life of the project or will it have to be upgraded or updated at some point? And how does the project team function? Are they all located together or spread out across several campuses or locations?\\n\\nThe answers to these questions should be documented in the communications management\\n\\nplan. We’ll cover that next.\\n\\nCommunications Management Plan\\n\\nAll projects require sound communication plans, but not all projects will have the same types of communication or the same methods for distributing the information. The communications man- agement plan, which is the only output of the Communications Planning process, documents the\\n\\n3601.book  Page 142  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n142\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2) Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\ntypes of information needs the stakeholders have, when the information should be distributed, and how the information will be delivered. The answer to the pop quiz I opened this section with is the communications management plan, which is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan we talked about in Chapter 3.\\n\\nThe type of information you will typically communicate includes project status, project scope statements and scope statement updates, project baseline information, risks, action items, performance measures, project acceptance, and so on. We’ll cover all of these topics in greater detail in the remaining chapters of this book. What’s important to know now is that the infor- mation needs of the stakeholders should be determined as early in the Planning process group as possible so that as you and your team develop project planning documents, you already know who should receive copies of them and how they should be delivered.\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, the communications management plan typically\\n\\ndescribes the following elements:\\n\\n(cid:2) Name of the item to be communicated\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPurpose for communication\\n\\nFrequency of communications\\n\\nTime frame for distribution, including starting and ending dates\\n\\nFormat of the communication and method of transmission\\n\\nPerson responsible for distributing the information\\n\\nThe information that will be shared with stakeholders and the distribution methods are based on the needs of the stakeholders, the project complexity, and the organizational policies. Some communications may be informal—a chat by the water cooler, for instance—while other communications are written and a copy is filed with the project files.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe communications management plan documents how the communication needs of the stakeholders will be met, including the types of information that will be communicated, who will communicate it, who receives the communication, the methods used to communicate, the timing and frequency, the method for updating this plan as the project progresses, escalation process, and a glossary of common terms.\\n\\nYou might consider setting up an intranet site for your project and posting the appropriate project documentation there for the stakeholders to access any time they wish. If you use this method, make sure to document it in the communications management plan and notify your stakeholders when updates or new communication is posted.\\n\\nChapter 8, “Developing the Project Team,” discusses communication methods in more depth.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 143  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Quality Standards\\n\\n143\\n\\nIdentifying Quality Standards\\n\\nQuality is affected by the triple constraints (project scope, schedule, and cost), and quality con- cerns are found in all projects. Quality typically defines whether stakeholder expectations were met. Being on time and on budget is one thing; if you deliver the wrong product or an inferior product, on time and on budget suddenly don’t mean much.\\n\\nThe Quality Planning process is concerned with targeting quality standards that are relevant to the project at hand and devising a plan to meet and satisfy those standards. The quality man- agement plan is an output of this process that describes how the quality policy will be imple- mented by the project management team during the course of the project. Another key output of this process is the process improvement plan, which documents the actions for analyzing pro- cesses to ultimately increase customer value. Everything discussed in this section, including the inputs and tools and techniques of this process, will be used to help develop these two primary outputs.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nQuality Planning is a key process performed during the Planning processes and when devel- oping the project management plan. It should be performed in conjunction with other Planning processes. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, “…quality is planned, designed, and built in— not inspected in.”\\n\\nQuality Inputs\\n\\nThe Quality Planning process has several inputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nThe two key elements we’ll cover regarding inputs are standards and regulations (which are part of the enterprise environmental factors input) and the quality policy (which is part of the organizational process assets input).\\n\\nStandards and Regulations\\n\\nThe project manager should consider any standards, regulations, guidelines, or rules that exist concerning the work of the project when writing the quality plan. A standard is something that’s approved by a recognized body and that employs rules, guidelines, or characteristics that should be followed. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has established standards\\n\\n3601.book  Page 144  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n144\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2) Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nfor web page designers that outline alternative viewing options of web pages for people with dis- abilities. PMI guidelines regarding project management are another example of standards.\\n\\nStandards aren’t mandatory, but it’s a good idea to follow them. For example, if you’re creating\\n\\na new software product that ignores standard protocols, your customers won’t be able to use it.\\n\\nStandards can be set by the organization, by independent bodies or organizations such as the\\n\\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO), and so on.\\n\\nA regulation is mandatory. Regulations are almost always imposed by governments or insti-\\n\\ntutions like the American Medical Association. However, organizations may have their own self-imposed regulations that you should be aware of as well. Regulations require strict adher- ence, particularly in the case of government-imposed regulations, or stiff penalties and fines could result—maybe even jail time if the offense is serious enough. Hmm, might be tough to practice project management from behind bars—not a recommended career move.\\n\\nIf possible, it’s a good idea to include information from the quality policy (we’ll cover this in the next section) and any standards, regulations, or guidelines that affect the project in the qual- ity management plan. If it’s not possible to include this information in the quality management plan, then at least make reference to the information and where it can be found. It’s the project management team’s responsibility to be certain all stakeholders are aware of and understand the policy issues and standards or regulations that might impact the project.\\n\\nContracts might have certain provisions for quality requirements that you should account for in the quality management plan. These provisions will also be discussed during the Procurement Planning processes. If the quality man- agement plan has already been written by the time these processes are per- formed, you should update the quality plan to reflect it.\\n\\nQuality Policy\\n\\nThe quality policy is part of the organizational process assets input. It’s a guideline published by executive management that describes what quality policies should be adopted for projects the company undertakes. It’s up to the project manager to understand this policy and incorpo- rate any predetermined company guidelines into the quality plan. If a quality policy does not exist, it’s up to the project management team to create one for the project.\\n\\nQuality Planning Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThe Quality Planning process has five tools and techniques used to help construct the quality management plan:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCost\\n\\n\\n\\nbenefit analysis\\n\\nBenchmarking\\n\\nDesign of experiments\\n\\nCost of quality\\n\\nAdditional quality planning tools\\n\\n3601.book  Page 145  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Quality Standards\\n\\n145\\n\\nMake sure you understand each of these tools and techniques and its purpose for the exam.\\n\\nLet’s take a look them now.\\n\\nCost\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefit Analysis\\n\\nYou’ve seen the cost-benefit analysis technique before in the Initiating process group. In the case of quality management, you’ll want to consider the trade-offs of the cost of quality. It’s cheaper and more efficient to prevent defects in the first place than to have to spend time and money fix- ing them later. The benefits of meeting quality requirements are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nStakeholder satisfaction is increased.\\n\\nCosts are lower.\\n\\nProductivity is higher.\\n\\nThere is less rework.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK notes that the primary cost of meeting quality requirements for a\\n\\nproject are the expenses incurred while performing project quality management activities.\\n\\nBenchmarking\\n\\nBenchmarking is a process of comparing previous similar activities to the current project activ- ities to provide a standard to measure performance against. This comparison will also help you derive ideas for quality improvements on the current project. For example, if your current printer can produce 8 pages per minute and you’re considering a new printer that produces 14 pages per minute, the benchmark is 8 pages per minute.\\n\\nDesign of Experiments\\n\\nDesign of experiments (DOE) is a statistical technique that identifies the elements—or vari- ables—that will have the greatest effect on overall project outcomes. It is used most often con- cerning the product of the project but can also be applied to project management processes to examine trade-offs. DOE designs and sets up experiments to determine the ideal solution for a problem using a limited number of sample cases. It analyzes several variables at once, allowing you to change all (or some of) the variables at the same time and determine which combination will produce the best result at a reasonable cost.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, remember that the key to DOE is that it equips you with a statistical framework that allows you to change all the important variables at once instead of changing one variable at a time.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 146  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n146\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2) Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nCost of Quality\\n\\nThe cost of quality (COQ) is the total cost to produce the product or service of the project according to the quality standards. These costs include all the work necessary to meet the prod- uct requirements whether the work was planned or unplanned. It also includes the costs of work performed due to nonconforming quality requirements.\\n\\nThere are three costs associated with the cost of quality:\\n\\nPrevention costs Prevention means keeping defects out of the hands of customers. Prevention costs are the costs associated with satisfying customer requirements by producing a product without defects. These costs are manifested early on in the process and include things like qual- ity planning, training, design review, and contractor and supplier costs.\\n\\nAppraisal costs Appraisal costs are the costs expended to examine the product or process and make certain the requirements are being met. Appraisal costs might include costs associated with things like inspections and testing. Prevention and appraisal costs are often passed on to the acquiring organization due to the limited duration of the project.\\n\\nFailure costs Failure costs are what it costs when things don’t go according to plan. Failure costs are also known as cost of poor quality. There are two types of failure costs:\\n\\nInternal failure costs These result when customer requirements are not satisfied while the product is still in the control of the organization. Internal failure costs may include corrective action, rework, scrapping, and downtime.\\n\\nExternal failure costs These occur when the product has reached the customer and they determine that their requirements have not been met. Costs associated with external failure costs may include inspections at the customer site, returns, and customer service costs.\\n\\nThe cost of quality can be affected by project decisions. Let’s say you’re produc- ing a new product. Unfortunately, the product scope description and/or project scope statement were inadequate to describe the functionality of the product. And, the project team produced the product exactly as specified in the project scope statement, WBS, and other planning documents. Once the product hit the store shelves, the organization was bombarded with returns and warranty claims because of the poor quality. Therefore, your project decisions impacted the cost of quality. Recall of products can also impact the cost of quality.\\n\\nCost of quality is a topic you’ll likely encounter on the exam. This section will discuss some of the pioneers in this field. Quality must be planned into the project, not inspected in after the fact to make certain the product or service meets stakeholders’ expectations.\\n\\nThree people in particular are responsible for the rise of the quality management movement and the theories behind the cost of quality: Philip B. Crosby, Joseph M. Juran, and W. Edwards Deming. Each of these men developed steps or points that led to commonly accepted quality processes that we use today and either developed or were the foundation for the development of quality processes such as Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, Cost of Quality, and Con- tinuous Improvement. We’ll also look at a quality technique called the Kaizen approach that originated in Japan.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 147  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Quality Standards\\n\\n147\\n\\nPhilip B. Crosby\\n\\nPhilip B. Crosby devised the zero defects practice, which means, basically, do it right the first time. (Didn’t your dad use to tell you this?) Crosby says that costs will increase when quality planning isn’t performed up front, which means you’ll have to engage in rework, thus affecting productivity. Prevention is the key to Crosby’s theory. If you prevent the defect from occurring in the first place, costs are lower, conformance to requirements is easily met, and the cost mea- surement for quality becomes the cost of nonconformance rather than the cost of rework.\\n\\nJoseph M. Juran\\n\\nJoseph M. Juran is noted for his fitness for use premise. Simply put, this means the stakeholders’ and customers’ expectations are met or exceeded. This says that conformance to specifica- tions—meaning the product of the project that was produced is what the project set out to pro- duce—is met or exceeded. Fitness for use specifically reflects the customers’ or stakeholders’ view of quality and answers the following questions:\\n\\n“Did the product or service produced meet the quality expectation?” “Did it satisfy a real need?” “Is it reliable and safe?” Juran also proposed that there could be grades of quality. However, you should not confuse grade with quality. Grade is a category for products or services that are of the same type but have differing technical characteristics. Quality describes how well the product or service (or characteristics of the product or service) fulfills the requirements. Low quality is usually not an acceptable condition; however, low grade might be. For example, your new Dad’s Dollars Credit Card software tracking system might be of high quality, meaning there are no bugs and the product performs as advertised, but of low grade, meaning there are few features. You’ll almost always want to strive for high quality, regardless of the acceptable grade level.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand the difference between quality and grade for the exam.\\n\\nW. Edwards Deming\\n\\nW. Edwards Deming suggested that as much as 85 percent of the cost of quality is a manage- ment problem. Once the quality issue has hit the floor, or the worker level, the workers have lit- tle control. For example, if you’re constructing a new highway and the management team that bid on the project proposed using inferior-grade asphalt, the workers laying the asphalt have lit- tle control over its quality. They’re at the mercy of the management team that purchased the supplies.\\n\\nDeming also proposed that workers cannot figure out quality on their own and thus cannot perform at their best. He believed that workers need to be shown what acceptable quality is and that they need to be made to understand that quality and continuous improvement are necessary elements of any organization—or project in your case.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 148  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n148\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2) Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nMany consider Deming to be the founder (or major contributor) of Total Quality Manage- ment (TQM). TQM, like Deming, says that the process is the problem, not people. Every person and all activities the company undertakes are involved with quality. TQM stipulates that qual- ity must be managed in and that quality improvement should be a continuous way of doing business, not a one-time performance of a specific task or process.\\n\\nSix Sigma is a quality management approach that is similar to TQM and is typically used in manufacturing and service-related industries. Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and variation reduction by applying Six Sigma methodologies to the project. There are two Six Sigma methodologies. The first is known as DMADV (define, measure, analyze, design, and verify) and is used to develop new processes or products at the Six Sigma level. The second is called DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and is used to improve existing processes or products. Another tidbit you should understand about Six Sigma is that it aims to eliminate defects and stipulates that no more than 3.4 defects per mil- lion are produced.\\n\\nKaizen Approach\\n\\nThe Kaizen approach is a quality technique from Japan. In fact, Kaizen means continuous improvement in Japanese. With this technique, all project team members and managers should be constantly watching for quality improvement opportunities. The Kaizen approach states that you should improve the quality of the people first, then the quality of the products or service. Continuous improvement involves everyone in the organization watching for ways to improve quality, whether incrementally or by incorporating new ideas into the process. This involves taking measurements, improving processes by making them repeatable and systemized, reducing variations in production or performance, reducing defects, and improving cycle times. TQM and Six Sigma are examples of continuous improvement.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand each of these men’s theories on the cost of quality for the exam. Here’s a key to help you remember:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCrosby = zero defects and prevention or rework results.\\n\\nJuran = fitness for use, conformance.\\n\\nDeming = quality is a management problem.\\n\\nTQM = quality must be managed in and must be a continuous process.\\n\\nSix Sigma = Six Sigma is a measurement based strategy; no more than 3.4 defects per million.\\n\\nKaizen = continuous improvement, improve quality of people first.\\n\\nContinuous improvement = watch continuously for ways to improve quality.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 149  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Quality Standards\\n\\n149\\n\\nAdditional Quality Planning Tools\\n\\nThe last tool and technique of the Quality Planning process is additional quality planning tools. A Guide to the PMBOK lists these additional tools as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nBrainstorming and nominal group techniques (We’ll cover both of these in Chapter 5, “Risk Planning.”)\\n\\nFlowcharts (We’ll cover this one in Chapter 10, “Measuring and Reporting Project Objectives.”)\\n\\nAffinity diagrams\\n\\nForce field analysis\\n\\n(cid:2) Matrix diagram\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPrioritization matrices\\n\\nI would memorize the names of these additional quality planning tools for the exam, but more importantly, you should understand both the names and concepts of the other tools and techniques we’ve already talked about in this section.\\n\\nQuality Planning Outputs\\n\\nQuality Planning uses many techniques to determine the areas of quality improvement that can be implemented, controlled, and measured throughout the rest of the project, as you’ve seen. These are recorded in the primary output of this process, which is called the quality manage- ment plan. The following list includes other outputs of this process:\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality metrics\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality checklists\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProcess improvement plan\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality baseline\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nProject management plan updates may come about as a result of changes to the quality man- agement plan, which in turn may come about as result of changes or corrections resulting from the Perform Quality Assurance process. We’ll talk about Perform Quality Assurance in Chapter 9. We’ll look at the remaining outputs of Quality Planning next.\\n\\nQuality Management Plan\\n\\nThe quality management plan describes how the project management team will enact the qual- ity policy. It should document the resources needed to carry out the quality plan, the responsi- bilities of the project team in implementing quality, and all the processes and procedures the project team and organization should use to satisfy quality requirements, including quality con- trol, quality assurance techniques, and continuous improvement processes.\\n\\nThe quality management plan is written by the project manager in cooperation with the project staff. You can assign quality actions to the activities listed on the work breakdown struc- ture (WBS) based on the quality plan requirements. Isn’t that WBS a handy thing? Later in the\\n\\n3601.book  Page 150  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n150\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2) Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nPerform Quality Control process, measurements will be taken to determine if the quality to date is on track with the quality standards outlined in the quality management plan.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe Quality Management knowledge area, which includes the Quality Planning, Perform Qual- ity Assurance, and Perform Quality Control processes, involves the quality management of the project as well as the quality aspects of the product or service the project was undertaken to produce. We’ll discuss Quality Assurance and Quality Control in later chapters.\\n\\nQuality Metrics\\n\\nA quality metric, also known as operational definition, describes what is being measured and how it will be measured by the Perform Quality Control process. For example, let’s say you’re managing the opening of a new restaurant in July of next year. Perhaps one of the deliverables is the procurement of flatware for 500 place settings. The operational definition in this case might include the date the flatware must be delivered and a counting or inventory process to ensure you received the number of place settings you ordered. Measurements consist of actual values, not yes or no results. In our example, receiving the flatware is a yes or no result (you have it or you don’t), but the date it was delivered and the number of pieces delivered are actual val- ues. Failure rates are another type of quality metric that is measurable, as are reliability, avail- ability, test coverage, and defect density measurements.\\n\\nQuality Checklists\\n\\nIf you’re like me, you start your day at the office with a big to-do list that has so many items on it you won’t be able to finish them all. Nevertheless, you faithfully write the list every day and check off the things that you accomplish throughout the day. Checklists are like this in that they provide a means to determine if the required steps in a process have been followed. As each step is completed, it’s checked off the list. Checklists can be activity specific or industry specific and might be very complex or easy to follow. Sometimes, organizations may have standard checklists they use for projects. You might also be able to obtain checklists from professional associations.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nBe aware that checklist shows up as both a process output and tool and technique. Quality checklists are an output of the Quality Planning process and checklist analysis is a tool and technique of the Risk Identification process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 151  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Quality Standards\\n\\n151\\n\\nCandy Works\\n\\nJuliette Walters is a contract project manager for Candy Works. It has introduced a new line of hard candy drops in various exotic flavors: caffe latte, hot buttered popcorn, and jalapeno spice, just to name a few.\\n\\nJuliette is writing the quality management plan for this project. After interviewing stakeholders and key team members, she’s found several quality factors of importance to the organization. Quality will be measured by the following criteria:\\n\\nCandy size Each piece should measure 3 mm.\\n\\nAppearance No visible cracks or breaks should appear in the candy.\\n\\nFlavor Flavor must be distinguishable when taste-tested.\\n\\nNumber produced The production target is 9,000 pieces per week. The current machine has been benchmarked at 9,200 candies per week.\\n\\nIntensity of color There should be no opaqueness in the darker colors.\\n\\nWrappers Properly fitting wrappers cover the candies, folding over twice in back and twisted on each side. There is a different wrapper for each flavor of candy, and they must be matched exactly.\\n\\nThe candy is cooked and then pulled into a long cylinder shape roughly 6 feet long and 2 feet in diameter. This cylinder is fed into the machine that molds and cuts the candy into drops. The cylinders vary a little in size, because they’re hand-stretched by expert candy makers prior to feeding them into the drop maker machine. As a result, the end of one flavor batch—the caffe latte flavor—and the beginning of the next batch—the hot buttered popcorn flavor—merge. This means the drops that fall into the collection bins are intermingled during the last run of the first flavor batch. In other words, the last bin of the caffe latte flavor run has some hot buttered popcorn drops mixed in. And, there isn’t a way to separate the drops once they’ve hit the bin. From here, the drops go on to the candy-wrapping machine, where brightly colored wrappers are matched to the candy flavor. According to the quality plan, hot buttered popcorn drops can- not be wrapped as caffe latte drops. Juliette ponders what to do.\\n\\nAs she tosses and turns that night thinking about the problem, it occurs to her to present this problem as an opportunity to the company rather than as a problem. In order to keep produc- tion in the 9,000 candies per week category, the machines can’t be stopped every time a new batch is introduced. So Juliette comes up with the idea to wrap candies from the intermixed bins with wrappers that say “Mystery Flavor.” This way, production keeps pace with the plan, and the wrapper/flavor quality problem is mitigated.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 152  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n152\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2) Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nProcess Improvement Plan\\n\\nThe process improvement plan focuses on finding inefficiencies in a process or activity and elim- inating them. The idea here is that if you’re doing activities or performing processes that don’t add any value, you’ll want to either stop doing what you’re doing or modify the process so that you are adding value. You should note that the process improvement plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. Some of the elements you should consider when thinking about process improvement are the process boundaries, which describes the purpose for the process and its expected start and end dates; the process configuration so that you know what processes are performed when and how they interact; the process metrics; and any specific elements you want to target for improvement.\\n\\nQuality Baseline\\n\\nAlmost everything you’ve done throughout this process culminates in the quality baseline. The quality baseline is the quality objective of the project. It’s what you’ll use to measure and report quality against as you perform the remaining Quality processes.\\n\\nOne of the results of the Quality Planning process is that your product or pro- cess may require adjustments to conform to the quality policy and standards. These changes may result in cost changes and schedule changes. You may also discover that you’ll need to perform risk analysis techniques for problems you uncover or when making adjustments as a result of this process.\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nYou’re just finishing a phone conversation with Jill, and you see Dirk headed toward your office.\\n\\nDirk walks in, crosses his arms over his chest, and stands next to your desk with an “I’m here for answers” look.\\n\\n“I thought I’d drop by and see if you have signed a lease and gotten Jake started on that build- out yet,” says Dirk.\\n\\n“I just got off the phone with Jill,” you reply. “The realtor found a great location and we’ve set up a tour at the end of this week.”\\n\\n“What’s been the holdup?” Dirk asks. “I thought we’d be ready to start the build-out about now.”\\n\\n“I’ve been working on the project plans.”\\n\\n“Project plans,” Dirk interrupts. “We already have a plan. That scope thing you drew up last week spelled things out pretty clearly.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 153  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Quality Standards\\n\\n153\\n\\n“The charter was the project kickoff, and the project scope statement listed all the deliverables and requirements. From there I had to break the work of the project down into manageable units of work. So, I’ve drawn up a work breakdown structure with all the deliverables shown in a tree structure that I’d like to go over with you before showing it to the project team.”\\n\\n“We aren’t building trees; we’re building a new store. I don’t understand why you’re wasting all this time planning. We all know what the objectives are.”\\n\\n“Dirk,” you reply, “if we put the right amount of effort and time into planning, the actual work of the project should go pretty smoothly. Planning is probably one of the most important things we can do on this project. If we don’t plan correctly, we might miss something very important that could delay the store opening. That date is pretty firm, I thought.”\\n\\n“Yes, the date is firm. But I don’t see how we could miss anything. You and I have met several times, and I know you’ve met with Jill and Jake. They’re the other key players on this.”\\n\\n“You’re right. I have met with Jill and Jake. And that’s a perfect example of why we need to plan. When I met with Jill, she told me how all the store’s data is communicated via a satellite network connection on a nightly basis. That means we need to involve the IT group.”\\n\\nYou glance down at your notes. “Ricardo Ramirez heads up IT. I spoke with him last week about his deliverables, and I’ve included his group as a subproject on the work breakdown structure.”\\n\\n“Oh,” Dirk replies. “I forgot about IT. You’re right, that’s an important part of the project, and we can’t leave them out. Don’t tell Ricardo I said this, but I’m not very technical myself and don’t really know what you’re going to need from him. I do know he also takes care of wiring and installing the point-of-sale terminals, but you’ll have to work all that out with him. Okay, I’m beginning to see why you’re taking planning seriously. Let’s have a look at this work break- down structure.”\\n\\nYou hand Dirk a copy of the WBS.

Two more items, Dirk. After meeting with Jake, Ricardo, and Jill, I’ve also drafted a communication plan and a quality management plan.

And the quality management plan…well you know the old saying, ‘Do it right the first time.’ It describes the plan for imple- menting our quality policy.

The highest levels of the WBS are described using nouns, and the lowest levels are described with verbs. Each element in the WBS has its own set of objectives and deliverables that must be met in order to fulfill the deliverables of the next highest level and ultimately the project itself. In this way, the WBS validates the com- pleteness of the work.\\n\\nThe lowest level of the WBS is known as work packages. This breakdown allows the project manager to determine cost estimates, time estimates, resource assignments, and quality controls. The purpose of the communications management plan is determining the communication needs of the stakeholders by defining the types of information needed, the format for commu- nicating the information, how often it’s distributed, and who prepares it. This plan is a subsid- iary plan of the project management plan.\\n\\nQuality Planning targets the quality standards that are relevant to your project. The quality\\n\\nmanagement plan outlines how the project team will enact the quality policy.\\n\\nYou need to consider the cost of quality when considering stakeholder needs. Three men led to the rise of the cost of quality theories. Crosby is known for his zero defects theory, Juran for the fitness for use theory, and Deming for contributing 85 percent of cost of quality to the man- agement team. The Kaizen approach says that the project team should continuously be on the lookout for ways to improve the process and that people should be improved first, then the quality of the products or services. TQM and Six Sigma are examples of continuous improve- ment techniques.\\n\\nCost-benefit analysis considers trade-offs in the Quality Planning process. Benchmarking compares previous similar activities to the current project activities to provide a standard to measure performance against. Design of experiments is an analytical technique that determines what variables have the greatest effect on the project outcomes. This technique equips you with a statistical framework, allowing you to change all the important variables at once instead of changing one variable at a time.\\n\\nCost of quality involves three types of costs: prevention, appraisal, and failure costs; the latter is also known as the cost of poor quality. Failure costs include both internal and external costs. The process improvement plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan and tar- gets inefficiencies in a process or activity. The quality baseline is used to document the quality objectives of the project and is used as a basis for future Quality processes.\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to define a WBS and its components. The WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy. It uses the deliverables from the project scope statement or similar documents and decomposes them into logical, manageable units of work. Level one is the major deliverable level or\\n\\n3601.book  Page 156  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n156\\n\\nChapter 4 (cid:2) Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan\\n\\nsubproject level, level two is a further elaboration of the deliverables, and so on. The lowest level of any WBS is called a work package.\\n\\nBe able to describe the purpose of the communications management plan. The communica- tions management plan determines the communication needs of the stakeholders. It documents what information will be distributed, how it will be distributed, to whom, and the timing of the distribution.\\n\\nBe able to identify the benefits of meeting quality requirements The benefits of meeting qual- ity requirements include increased stakeholder satisfaction, lower costs, higher productivity, and less rework and are discovered during the Quality Planning process.\\n\\nBe able to define the cost of quality The COQ is the total cost to produce the product or ser- vice of the project according to the quality standards. These costs include all the work necessary to meet the product requirements. The three costs associated with cost of quality are prevention, appraisal, and failure costs (also known as cost of poor quality).\\n\\nBe able to name three people associated with COQ and some of the techniques they helped establish Crosby, Juran, and Deming. Some of the techniques they helped to establish are TQM, Six Sigma, cost of quality, and continuous improvement. The Kaizen approach concerns continuous improvement and says people should be improved first.\\n\\nBe able to name the tools and techniques of the Quality Planning process Cost benefit anal- ysis, benchmarking, design of experiments, cost of quality, additional quality planning tools.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 157  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\n157\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

There isn’t enough information in the question to know if option B is correct, although it\\n\\ncould be. Option C is not correct because the next process after the scope management plan is created is the Scope Definition process.

The WBS dictionary should be documented with the code of account identifier, an SOW, the responsible organization, and a milestone schedule for the WBS components. Option C is not correct because the amount of elaboration and detail the question describes would make the WBS inefficient. You need only enough detail to make it easier for the project team to plan, man- age, and control the work. Approved change requests are inputs to this process. Requested changes are the output.\\n\\n6. B.

The processes we’re going to discuss here have outputs that become inputs to the Planning processes we’ll discuss in the coming chapters.\\n\\nRisk is evident in everything we do. When it comes to project management, understanding risk and knowing how to minimize its impacts (or take full advantage of its opportunities) on your project is essential for success. This entire chapter is dedicated to project risk. Five of the six risk processes (all contained in the Risk Management knowledge area) fall in the Planning process group. We’ll cover Risk Management Planning, Risk Identification, Qualitative Risk Analysis, Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Risk Response Planning in this chapter. We’ll follow up with the last risk process, Risk Monitoring and Control, in Chapter 9, “Monitoring and Controlling Project Performance.”\\n\\nHold on to your hats! We’re going to cover a lot of material in this chapter, but it will go fast,\\n\\nI promise.\\n\\nPlanning for Risks\\n\\nEvery one of us takes risks on a daily basis. Just getting out of bed in the morning is a risk. You might stub your toe in the dark on the way to the light switch or trip over the dog and break a leg. These things don’t usually happen, but the possibility exists. The same is true for your project. Risk exists on all projects, and the potential that a particular risk will occur depends on the nature of the risk.\\n\\nRisk, like most of the elements of the other Planning processes, changes as the project progresses and should be monitored throughout the project. As you get close to a risk event, that’s the time to reassess your original assumptions about the risk and your plans to deal with the risk and to make any adjustments as required.\\n\\nNot all risks are bad. Risks can present opportunities as well as threats to a project. All risks have causes, and if the risk event occurs during a project, there are consequences as a result of that risk. Those consequences will likely impact one or more of the project objectives, and you’ll need to know if the consequences have positive or negative impacts.\\n\\nRisk is, after all, uncertainty. The more you know about risks and their impacts, the better equipped you are to handle a risk when it occurs. The processes that involve risk, probably more than any other project Planning process, concerns balance. You want to find that point where you and the stakeholders are comfortable taking the risk based on the benefits you can potentially\\n\\n3601.book  Page 167  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nRisk Management Planning\\n\\n167\\n\\ngain. In a nutshell, you’re balancing the action of taking a risk against avoiding the consequences or impacts of a risk. The rest of this chapter will deal with finding out what risks may occur (and how to deal with those risks that are unknown), determining an organization’s tolerance for risk taking, and developing action plans for those risks we’ve determined have hefty impacts. The first step is performing the Risk Management Planning process. Here, you determine the approach you’ll use for risk management activities and document your plans for them in a risk management plan. Let’s look at that process now.\\n\\nRisk Management Planning\\n\\nRisks come about for many reasons. Some are internal to the project, and some are external. The project environment, the planning process, the project management process, inadequate resources, and so on can all contribute to risk. Some risks you’ll know about in advance and Risk Man- plan for during this process; others will occur unannounced during the project. The agement Planning\\n\\nprocess determines how you’ll plan for risks on your project.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK states that the Risk Management Planning process is an important foun- dation for all the risk processes that follow “…to ensure that the level, type, and visibility of risk management are commensurate with both the risk and importance of the project to the orga- nization, to provide sufficient resources and time for risk management activities, and to estab- lish an [emphasis mine].” Understand this concept, particularly that you’re developing an agreed-upon basis for risk evaluation, for the exam.\\n\\nagreed-upon basis for evaluating risk\\n\\nIn order to document the risk management plan, we need to gather some inputs that will help us determine our organizations risk policies and tolerance for risk. We’ll look at those inputs next.\\n\\nInputs of Risk Management Planning\\n\\nRisks associated with a project generally concern the project objectives, which in turn impact time, cost, scope, or quality or any combination of the four. As you might have guessed, the project scope statement is an input to this process since it spells out your project objectives. The inputs of this process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\n3601.book  Page 168  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n168\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2)\\n\\nRisk Planning\\n\\nrisk tolerance\\n\\nOne of the key elements of the enterprise environmental factors to consider as in input in this levels of the organization and the stakeholders. Risk tolerance is process is the that balance we talked about earlier where stakeholders are comfortable taking a risk because the benefits to be gained outweigh what could be lost—or just the opposite. They will avoid tak- ing a risk because the cost or impact is too great given the amount of benefit that can be derived. Here’s an example to describe risk tolerance: Suppose you’re a 275-pound brute who’s sur- rounded by three body guards of equal proportion everywhere you go. Chances are, walking down a dark alley in the middle of the night doesn’t faze you in the least. That means your risk tolerance for this activity is high. However, if you’re a petite 90-pounder without benefit of body guards or karate lessons, performing this same activity might give you cause for concern. Your risk tolerance is low, meaning you wouldn’t likely do this activity. The higher your toler- ance for risk, the more you’re willing to take on risk and their consequences.\\n\\nOrganizations and stakeholders, as well as individuals, all have different toler- ances for risk. One organization might believe that the risk of a potential 17 per- cent cost overrun is high, while another might think it’s low. However, either one of these organizations may decide to accept the risk if they believe it’s in balance with the potential rewards. It’s important for the project manager to understand the tolerance level the organization and the stakeholders have for risk before evaluating and ranking risk.\\n\\nRemember that organizational process assets include policies and guidelines that may already exist in the organization. Your organization’s risk management policies are any policies it might have that you should consider when planning for risks. Defined roles and responsibil- ities that outline what authority levels the stakeholders and/or project manager have for making decisions regarding risk planning may exist in these policies. (Do consider that these decisions can affect other planning processes.) Your organization may also have preexisting templates that you can use during this process. These templates should be updated on a regular basis and examined for their appropriateness on this project.\\n\\nThe project scope statement, as mentioned earlier, contains the project objectives and deliv- erables. This is the first place you’ll start looking when identifying risks and should be consid- ered when determining the process you’ll use to evaluate risks. The risk management plan (the only output of this process) will become part of the project management plan, so obviously, other project management processes and guidelines should be considered when performing this process so that the risk management plan is in line with the overall direction and management of the project.\\n\\nTools and Techniques for Risk Management Planning\\n\\nThere is only one tool and technique of the Risk Management Planning process: planning meet- ings and analysis. The purpose of these meetings, which are held with project team members, stakeholders, functional managers, and others who may have involvement in the risk management process, is to contribute to the risk management plan. During these meetings, the fundamental\\n\\n3601.book  Page 169  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nRisk Management Planning\\n\\n169\\n\\nplans for performing risk management activities will be discussed and determined and then doc- umented in the risk management plan.\\n\\nThe key outcomes of performing these planning meetings are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRisk cost elements are developed for inclusion in the project budget.\\n\\nSchedule activities are developed for inclusion in the project schedule.\\n\\nRisk responsibilities are assigned.\\n\\nTemplates for risk categories are defined or modified for this project.\\n\\nDefinitions of terms (\\n\\nand documented.\\n\\nprobability,\\n\\nimpact,\\n\\nrisk types,\\n\\nrisk levels,\\n\\nand so on) are developed\\n\\nThe probability and impact matrix is defined or modified for this project.\\n\\nWe’ll discuss risk responsibilities, define the terms in the preceding list, and construct our own probability and impact matrix in the remaining sections of this chapter.\\n\\nUltimately, our goal for this process concerns documenting the risk management plan (the output of this process). This document contains the basis for understanding the remaining risk processes. Since the risk management plan encompasses a wealth of information, I’ve given this topic its own section. Let’s get to it.\\n\\nCreating the Risk Management Plan\\n\\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Planning process is to create a risk management plan, which describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan and it’s the only output of this process.\\n\\nThe risk management plan details how risk management processes (including Risk Identifi-\\n\\ncation, Qualitative Risk Analysis, Quantitative Risk Analysis, Risk Response Planning, and Risk Monitoring and Control) will be implemented, monitored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. It details how you will manage risks but does not attempt to define responses to individual risks.\\n\\nWe’ll talk about how to develop those response plans in the section “Develop- ing a Risk Response Plan” later in this chapter.\\n\\nAccording to\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nthe risk management plan should include the follow-\\n\\ning elements:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nRoles and responsibilities\\n\\n3601.book  Page 170  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n170\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2)\\n\\nRisk Planning\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nBudgeting\\n\\nTiming\\n\\nRisk categories\\n\\nDefinitions of risk probability and impact\\n\\nProbability and impact matrix\\n\\nRevised stakeholder tolerances\\n\\nReporting formats\\n\\nTracking\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nIt’s very important to spend time developing the risk management plan because it’s an input to every other risk-planning process and enhances the probability of risk management success.\\n\\nWe’ll take a look at most of these elements next. However, risk categories, probability and impact, and probability and impact matrix are pretty meaty topics, so we’ll cover those in their own sections following this one.\\n\\nMethodology Methodology is a description of how you’ll perform risk management, including ele- ments like methods, tools, and where you might find risk data that you can use in the later processes.\\n\\nRoles and responsibilities Roles and responsibilities describe the team of people who are respon- sible for managing the identified risks and their responses and for each type of activity identified in the risk management plan. These risk teams might not be the same as the project team. Risk analysis should be unbiased, which may not be possible when project team members are involved.\\n\\nThe budget for risk management is included in the plan as well. In this section,\\n\\nBudgeting you’ll assign resources and estimate the costs of risk management and its methods. These costs will then be included in the project cost baseline. (We’ll talk about that in Chapter 7, “Creating the Project Schedule and Budget.”)\\n\\nTiming Timing documents the timing of the risk management processes (including when and how often they’ll be performed on the project) and includes the activities associated with risk management in the project schedule.\\n\\nRevised stakeholder tolerances management processes, you may find that risk tolerances will change. Document those new tol- erance levels in the risk management plan.\\n\\nThis is just as it implies. As you proceed through the risk\\n\\nReporting formats describe the content of the risk register and the format Reporting formats of this document. (We’ll talk more about the risk register later in this chapter.) Reporting for- mats also detail how risk management information will be maintained, updated, analyzed, and reported to project participants.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 171  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nRisk Management Planning\\n\\n171\\n\\nTracking This includes a description of how you’ll document the history of the risk activities for the current project and how the risk processes will be audited. You can reference this infor- mation when you’re performing risk-planning processes later in the current project or on future projects. This information is also helpful for lessons learned, which we’ll cover in Chapter 11, “Closing Out the Project.”\\n\\nRisk Categories\\n\\nare a way to systematically identify risks and provide a foundation for under- Risk categories standing. When determining and identifying risks, the use of risk categories helps improve the process by giving everyone involved a common language or basis for describing risk.\\n\\nRisk categories should be identified during this process and documented in the risk manage- ment plan. You will use these categories during the next process, Risk Identification, to help identify risks. The following list includes some of the categories you might identify during this process (or modify based on previous project information):\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTechnical, quality, or performance risks\\n\\nProject management risks\\n\\nOrganizational risks\\n\\nExternal risks\\n\\nThere are a couple of ways you can go about describing categories of risk. One way is simply\\n\\nlisting them. You could, and should, review prior projects for risk categories and then tailor them for this project.\\n\\nYou could also construct a\\n\\nrisk breakdown structure (RBS),\\n\\nwhich lists the categories and\\n\\nsubcategories. A sample of an RBS is shown in Figure 5.1.\\n\\nRemember that the organizational process assets input may include an RBS that you can reference for this project. And don’t forget your PMO. They may have templates or an RBS already developed.\\n\\nRisk categories may reflect the type of industry or application area in which the project exists. For example, Information Technology projects will likely have many risks that fall into the technical category, whereas construction projects may be more subject to risks that fall into the external risks category. The categories do not have to be industry specific, however. Keep in mind that project management, for example, is a risk on every project in every industry. A description of each of the categories is shown next:\\n\\nTechnical/quality/performance risks Technical, quality, or performance risks include risks associated with unproven technology, complex technology, or changes to technology antici- pated during the course of the project. Performance risks may include unrealistic performance goals. Perhaps one of the project deliverables concerns a component manufactured to specific performance standards that have never been achieved. That’s a performance risk.\\n\\nProject management risks The project management risk category includes improper schedule and resource planning, poor project planning, and improper or poor project management dis- ciplines or methodologies.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 172  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n172\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2)\\n\\nRisk Planning\\n\\nF I G U R E 5 . 1\\n\\nRisk breakdown structure\\n\\nProject Name\\n\\nTechnical\\n\\nProject Management\\n\\nOrganizational\\n\\nExternal\\n\\nUnproven Technology\\n\\nSchedule Planning\\n\\nProject Schedules\\n\\nWeather\\n\\nQuality of Technology\\n\\nProject Disciplines\\n\\nUnrealistic Objectives\\n\\nLabor Issues\\n\\nPerformance Risks\\n\\nResource Planning\\n\\nLack of Funding\\n\\nCatastrophic Risk\\n\\nComplex Technology\\n\\nCost Estimates\\n\\nBudgets\\n\\nThe organizational risk category can include resource conflicts due to\\n\\nOrganizational risks multiple projects occurring at the same time in the organization; scope, time, and cost objectives that are unrealistic given the organization’s resources or structure; and lack of funding for the project or diverting funds from this project to other projects.\\n\\nThe external risk category includes those things external to the project, such as\\n\\nExternal risks new laws or regulations, labor issues, weather, changes in ownership, and foreign policy for —are usu- projects performed in other countries. Catastrophic risks—known as ally outside the scope of risk management planning and instead require disaster recovery tech- niques. Force majeure includes events like earthquakes, meteorites, volcanoes, floods, civil unrest, terrorism, and so on.\\n\\nforce majeure\\n\\nDefining Probability and Impact\\n\\nWhen you’re writing the risk management plan, you’ll want to document how probability and impact will be defined on the project. Probability describes the potential for the risk event occur- ring, while impact describes the impact, or consequences, the project will experience if the risk event occurs. This definition can be very sophisticated or simple. For example, you may use numeric values to define probability and impact or simply assign a high-medium-low rating to\\n\\n3601.book  Page 173  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Potential Risk\\n\\n173\\n\\neach risk. What’s important to note now is that you don’t use these probability and impact def- initions here. You use these definitions later in the Qualitative Risk Analysis process. (We’ll talk in depth about probability and impact in the section “Analyzing Risk Using Qualitative Tech- niques” later in this chapter.) But you should define and document them here in the risk man- agement plan.\\n\\nProbability and Impact Matrix\\n\\nprobability and impact matrix\\n\\ndefines the combination of probability and impact that helps A you determine which risks need detailed risk response plans. For example, a risk with a high probability of occurring and a high impact will likely need a response plan. This matrix is typ- ically defined by the organization, but if you don’t have one, you’ll need to develop this now— during your planning meeting and analysis (the tool and technique of this process). You’ll use this matrix in the Qualitative Risk Analysis process, and we’ll talk more in depth in the section about this technique. Again, you want to define (or modify) the probability and impact matrix in the risk management plan\\n\\nThe key thing to note about this process is that you’ll define what the probabil- ity and impact tools look like now during Risk Management Planning so that the team has an agreed-upon basis for evaluating the identified risks later during the Qualitative Risk Analysis process.\\n\\nTo recap, the steps associated with these last few elements of the risk management plan are\\n\\nas follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDefine the risk categories (to be used in the Risk Identification process).\\n\\nDetermine how probability and impact will be defined (to be used in the Qualitative Risk Analysis process).\\n\\nDefine or modify the probability and impact matrix (to be used in the Qualitative Risk Analysis process).\\n\\nAll these things, together with the other elements of the risk management plan, give you and\\n\\nthe risk management team a common understanding for evaluating risks throughout the remainder of the project.\\n\\nIdentifying Potential Risk\\n\\nRisk Identification\\n\\nprocess involves identifying all the risks that might impact the project,\\n\\nThe documenting them, and documenting their characteristics. Risk Identification is an iterative process that continually builds on itself. As you progress through the project, more risks may present themselves (those you didn’t identify early on in the Planning process). Once you’ve identified or discovered a potential new risk, you should analyze it to determine if a response plan is needed. You can see that the risk management cycle starts again with Risk Identification and progresses through the remaining risk processes to determine what to do about them.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 174  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n174\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2)\\n\\nRisk Planning\\n\\nYou can include several groups of folks to help identify risks, including project team mem- bers, stakeholders, subject matter experts, users, and anyone else who you think may help in the process. Perhaps in the first round of Risk Identification, you include just the project team and subject matter experts, and then you bring in the stakeholders or risk management team to fur- ther flesh out risks during the second round of identification.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about the techniques you can use to identify risks in the section titled “Tools and Techniques Used to Identify Risk.”\\n\\nRisks may or may not adversely affect the project. Some risks have positive consequences,\\n\\nwhile others have negative consequences. However, all risk events and their consequences should be identified. Here’s a partial list to get you thinking about where risk may be found:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nBudgets/funding\\n\\nSchedules\\n\\nScope or requirements changes\\n\\nProject plan\\n\\nProject management processes\\n\\nTechnical issues\\n\\nPersonnel issues\\n\\n(cid:2) Hardware\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nContracts\\n\\nPolitical concerns\\n\\nBusiness risk\\n\\nLegal risk\\n\\nEnvironmental risk\\n\\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list. Remember that risk is uncertainty and realize that risk (uncertainty) is lurking almost anywhere on your project. It’s your job to discover as many of the potential risks as possible using the tools and techniques of this process and to document these risks.\\n\\nRisk Identification Inputs\\n\\nThe inputs to the Risk Identification process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nRisk management plan\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\n3601.book  Page 175  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Potential Risk\\n\\n175\\n\\nAs usual, the enterprise environmental factors input concerns things from outside the project\\n\\nthat may help you determine or influence project outcomes. Be certain to check for industry information (commercial databases, checklists, benchmarking studies, and so on) or academic research that might exist for your application areas regarding risk information.\\n\\nAs always, don’t forget about historical information like previous project experiences via the\\n\\nproject files. Project team knowledge is another form of historical information.\\n\\nThe project scope statement contains a list of project assumptions. Assumptions are things believed to be true. It’s imperative during the risk-planning stages of your project and through- out the work of the project to revisit and revalidate your project assumptions. At the time you recorded an assumption about vendor deliveries, for example, the vendor had a great track record and never missed a date. Months later on the project, that vendor merges with one of its competitors. Now you’ll need to reexamine your assumptions about delivery times and deter- mine if the assumption is still valid or whether you have a risk on your hands.\\n\\nYou should pay particular attention to the roles and responsibilities section of the risk man- agement plan and the budget and schedule for risk activities, and don’t forget to examine the categories of risks. This is a great place to start when you get the team together and begin brain- storming your list of risks.\\n\\nThe project management plan contains several other management plans (like schedule, qual-\\n\\nity, and cost) that can be helpful sources also when identifying risks.\\n\\nAlthough A Guide to the PMBOK doesn’t mention it, I’ve found that other ele- ments of your project are helpful when identifying risk, such as the work break- down structure (WBS), cost and schedule estimates, the staffing management plan, project staff assignments, and resource availability. You should really examine the outputs of most of the processes.\\n\\nTools and Techniques Used to Identify Risk\\n\\nThe Risk Identification process is undertaken using five tools and techniques:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDocumentation reviews\\n\\nInformation\\n\\n\\n\\ngathering techniques\\n\\nChecklist analysis\\n\\nAssumptions analysis\\n\\nDiagramming techniques\\n\\nDocumentation reviews involve reviewing project plans, assumptions, and historical infor- mation from a total project perspective as well as at the individual deliverables or activities level. This review helps the project team identify risks associated with the project objectives. Pay attention to the quality of the plans (is the content complete or does it seem to be lacking detail?) and the consistency between plans. An exceptionally documented schedule is great, but if the budget isn’t as well documented, you may have some potential risks. Let’s look at the remaining tools and techniques of this process, starting with information gathering.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 176  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n176\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nInformation Gathering\\n\\nInformation gathering encompasses several techniques, including brainstorming, the Delphi technique, interviewing, root cause identification, and strength and weakness analysis. The goal of these techniques is to end up with a comprehensive list of risks at the end of the meeting. Let’s take a quick look at each of these techniques.\\n\\nBrainstorming\\n\\nBrainstorming is probably the most often used technique of the Risk Identification process. You’ve probably used this technique many times for many purposes. Brainstorming involves getting subject matter experts, team members, risk management team members, and anyone else who might benefit the process in a room and asking them to start identifying possible risk events. The trick here is that one person’s idea might spawn another idea and so on, so that by the end of the session you’ve iden- tified all the possible risks. The facilitator could start the group off by going through the categories of risks to get everyone thinking in the right direction.\\n\\nDelphi Technique\\n\\nThe Delphi technique is a lot like brainstorming, only the people participating in the meeting don’t necessarily know each other. In fact, the people participating in this technique don’t all have to be located in the same place and can participate anonymously. You can use e-mail to facilitate the Delphi technique very easily.\\n\\nWhat you do is assemble your experts, from both inside and outside the company, and ask them via a questionnaire to identify potential risks. They in turn send their responses back to you (or to the facilitator of this process). All the responses are organized by content and sent back to the Delphi members for further input, additions, or comments. The participants then send their comments back one more time, and a final list of risks is compiled by the facilitator. The Delphi technique is a great tool that allows consensus to be reached very quickly. It also helps prevent one person from unduly influencing the others in the group and thus prevents bias in the outcome because the participants are usually anonymous and don’t necessarily know how others in the group responded.\\n\\nNominal Group Technique\\n\\nAnother technique that is similar to the Delphi technique is the nominal group technique. It isn’t a named tool and technique of this process, but it is a technique you might find useful and that you may find on the exam.\\n\\nThis technique requires the participants to be together in the same room. Each participant has paper and pencil in front of them, and they are asked to write down what risks they think the project faces. Using sticky-backed notes is a good way to do this. Each piece of paper should contain only one risk. The papers are given to the facilitator, who sticks them up to the wall or a white board. The panel is then asked to review all the risks posted on the board; rank them and prioritize them, in writing; and submit the ranking to the facilitator. Once this is done, you should have a complete list of risks.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 177  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Potential Risk\\n\\n177\\n\\nInterviewing\\n\\nInterviews are question-and-answer sessions held with others, including other project manag- ers, subject matter experts, stakeholders, customers, the management team, project team mem- bers, and users. These folks provide you with possible risks based on their past experiences with similar projects.\\n\\nThis technique involves interviewing those folks with previous experience on projects similar to yours or those with specialized knowledge or industry expertise. Ask them to tell you about any risks that they’ve experienced or that they think may happen on your project. Show them the WBS and your list of assumptions to help get them started thinking in the right direction.\\n\\nRoot Cause Identification\\n\\nDid you ever hear someone say you’re looking at the symptoms and not at the problem? That’s the idea here. Root cause identification involves digging deeper than the risk itself and looking at what the cause of the risk is. This helps define the risk more clearly and it also helps you later when it’s time to develop the response plan for the risk.\\n\\nStrengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)\\n\\nStrengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (also known as SWOT analysis) is an analysis technique that examines through each of these viewpoints (SWOT) the project itself, project management processes, resources, the organization, and so on. It also helps broaden your per- spective of where to look for risks.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nNot all of the techniques listed here are detailed in A Guide to the PMBOK. Be aware that there might be questions on any of the techniques I’ve shown here. Understand the difference between the various information-gathering techniques for the exam.\\n\\nChecklist Analysis\\n\\nChecklists used during the Risk Identification process are usually developed based on historical information and previous project team experience. If you typically work on projects that are similar in nature, begin to compile a list of risks. You can then convert this to a checklist that will allow you to identify risks on future projects quickly and easily. You can also use the lowest level of the RBS as a checklist. However, don’t rely solely on checklists for Risk Identification because you might miss important risks. It isn’t possible for a single checklist to be an exhaustive source for all projects. You can improve your checklists at the end of the project by adding the new risks that were identified.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 178  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n178\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nAssumptions Analysis\\n\\nAssumptions analysis is a matter of validating the assumptions you identified and documented during the course of the project Planning processes. Assumptions should be accurate, complete, and consistent. Examine all your assumptions for these qualities. Assumptions are also used as a jumping-off point to further identify risks.\\n\\nThe important thing to note about the project assumptions is that all assumptions are tested\\n\\nagainst two factors:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe strength of the assumption or the validity of the assumption\\n\\nThe consequences that may impact the project if the assumption turns out to be false\\n\\nAll assumptions that turn out to be false should be evaluated and scored just as risks.\\n\\nDiagramming Techniques\\n\\nThere are three types of diagramming techniques used in Risk Identification: cause-and-effect, system or process flowcharts, and influence diagrams. Cause-and-effect diagrams show the rela- tionship between the effects of problems and their causes. This diagram depicts every potential cause and subcause of a problem and the effect that each proposed solution will have on the problem. This diagram is also called a fishbone diagram, or Ishikawa diagram after its devel- oper, Kaoru Ishikawa. Figure 5.2 shows an example cause-and-effect diagram.\\n\\nThe system or process flowchart shows the logical steps needed to accomplish an objective, how the elements of a system relate to each other, and what actions cause what responses. This flowchart is probably the one you’re most familiar with. It’s usually constructed with rectangles and parallelograms that step through a logical sequence and allow for “yes” and “no” branches (or some similar type of decision). Figure 5.3 shows a flowchart to help determine if risk response plans should be developed for the risk (we’ll talk about response plans in the Developing a Risk Response Plan section later in this chapter).\\n\\nF I G U R E 5 . 2\\n\\nCause\\n\\n\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\n\\neffect diagram\\n\\nCause\\n\\nEffect\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nProcess\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nDefects\\n\\nWrong\\n\\nOrder\\n\\nNo Training\\n\\nIncompatible\\n\\nAvailability\\n\\nDamaged\\n\\nProject Staff\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nProblem or\\n\\nDefect Statement\\n\\n3601.book  Page 179  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nIdentifying Potential Risk\\n\\n179\\n\\nF I G U R E 5 . 3\\n\\nFlowchart diagram\\n\\nRisk owner notifies PM of event or risk trigger.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nShould the\\n\\nresponse plan be put\\n\\ninto action?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nResponse plans\\n\\nreexamined for\\n\\nassurance of\\n\\nsuccessful mitigation.\\n\\nReview risk scores.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nHigh risk\\n\\nscore?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nMeeting to review risk\\n\\nand response plans.\\n\\nAssign resources and\\n\\nimplement plan.\\n\\nMonitor effectiveness\\n\\nof response plan\\n\\nand report status.\\n\\nRisk owner and PM\\n\\ndocument results.\\n\\nCause-and-effect diagrams and system or process flowcharts are used in the Risk Identification process as well as in the Perform Quality Control process.\\n\\nA third diagramming technique used during Risk Identification is called influence diagrams. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, influence diagrams typically show the casual influences\\n\\n3601.book  Page 180  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n180\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\namong project variables, the timing or time ordering of events, and the relationships among other project variables and their outcomes. Simply put, they visually depict risks (or decisions), uncertainties or impacts, and how they influence each other. Figure 5.4 shows an influence dia- gram for a product introduction decision. The weather is a variable that could impact delivery time and delivery time is a variable that can impact when revenues will occur.\\n\\nF I G U R E 5 . 4\\n\\nInfluence diagram\\n\\nProduct\\n\\nintroduction\\n\\nWeather\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\ntimes\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\nEach of these techniques provides a way for you to help identify project risks. It’s important that you identify all the risks early on. The better job you do of identifying the project’s risks at the Planning stage, the more comprehensive the risk response plan will be. Risk Identification is not an area of project Planning that you should skip.\\n\\nRisk Identification Outputs\\n\\nThe output of the Risk Identification process is the risk register. Everything you’ve done in this process up to this point will get documented here. The risk register contains the following elements:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nList of identified risks\\n\\nList of potential responses\\n\\nRoot causes of risks\\n\\nUpdated risk categories\\n\\nWe’ll take a look at each one next. Understand that all risks should be documented, tracked,\\n\\nreviewed, and managed throughout the project.\\n\\nList of Identified Risks\\n\\nRisks are all the potential events and their subsequent consequences that could occur as iden- tified by you and others during this process. You might want to consider logging your risks in a risk database or tracking system to organize them and keep a close eye on their status. This can easily be done in spreadsheet format or whatever method you choose. List the risks and assign each risk a tracking number. This gives you a means to track the risks, their occurrence, and the responses implemented.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 181  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nAnalyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques\\n\\n181\\n\\nList of Potential Responses\\n\\nPotential responses to risk may be identified at the same time you’re identifying the risks. Some- times just identifying the risk will tell you the appropriate response. Document those responses here. You’ll refer to them again in the Risk Response Planning process a little later in this chapter.\\n\\nRoot Causes of Risk\\n\\nWe talked about this one before. When you’re identifying risks, be sure you go further than that and try to identify the cause. Document those causes you’ve identified here in the risk register.\\n\\nUpdated Risk Categories\\n\\nAs a result of identifying and documenting your risks, you may well discover some categories of risk need changed or updated to reflect the risks for the current project. This might also include updating the RBS. It’s a good practice to update those categories now, while you’re in the midst of the process. Your next project will be all the better for it.\\n\\nTriggers\\n\\nIf you’ve ever suffered from a hay fever attack, you can’t mistake the itchy, runny nose and scratchy throat that can come on suddenly and send you into a sneezing frenzy. Signals like this are known as triggers and work the same way when determining if a risk event is about to occur. For example, if you’re planning an outdoor gathering and rain clouds start rolling in from the north on the morning of the activity, you probably have a risk event waiting to happen. A key team member hinting about job hunting is a warning sign that they may be thinking of leaving, which in turn can cause schedule delays, increased costs, and so on. This is another example of a trigger.\\n\\nTriggers are not listed as one of the risk register elements, but in practice, this is an appro-\\n\\npriate place to list them. You will likely encounter questions on the exam about triggers, so don’t say I didn’t warn you. Also, throughout the remainder of the project, be on the alert for triggers that might signal that a risk event is about to occur.\\n\\nAnalyzing Risks Using Qualitative\\n\\nTechniques\\n\\nThe Qualitative Risk Analysis process involves determining what impact the identified risks will have on the project objectives and the probability they’ll occur. It also ranks the risks in priority order according to their effect on the project objectives. This helps the team determine if Quan- titative Risk Analysis should be performed or if you can skip right to developing response plans. The Qualitative Risk Analysis process also considers risk tolerance levels, especially as they relate to the project constraints (scope, time, cost, and quality) and the time frames of the poten- tial risk events.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 182  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n182\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nThe Qualitative Risk Analysis process should be performed throughout the project. This pro- cess is the one you’ll find you’ll use most often when prioritizing project risk because it’s fast, relatively easy to perform, and cost effective. A Guide to the PMBOK mentions two techniques you can use during this process to help correct biases that can occur in the data you’ve gathered: definitions of probability and impact (this is part of the risk management plan we discussed ear- lier in this chapter) and expert interviewing (we talked about this in the Risk Identification sec- tion of this chapter).\\n\\nQualitative Risk Analysis Inputs\\n\\nThe Qualitative Risk Analysis process has four inputs:\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nRisk management plan\\n\\nThe risk register\\n\\nAs with the Risk Identification process, you should examine historical information and les- sons learned from past projects as a guide for prioritizing the risks for this project. As we’ve discussed before, these are part of the organizational process assets input. The project scope statement describes the deliverables of the project, and from there you should be able to deter- mine if you’re dealing with a high level of uncertainty or a project that’s similar in size and scope to one you’ve performed before. Projects with high levels of uncertainty or that are more complex than what the team has undertaken before require more diligence during the Qualitative Risk Analysis process.\\n\\nThe risk management plan documented the roles and responsibilities of risk team members, budget and schedule factors for risk activities, the stakeholder risk tolerances, the definitions for probability and impact, and the probability and impact matrix, all of which should be consid- ered when prioritizing risks. We’ll examine probability and impact more closely in the next sec- tion, “Using the Tools and Techniques of Qualitative Risk Analysis.”\\n\\nThe critical element in this process, as with most of the processes you’ll find where risk reg-\\n\\nister is an input, is the list of risks.\\n\\nThe real key to this process lies in the tools and techniques you’ll use to prioritize risks. Hold\\n\\non tight because we’re going in the deep end.\\n\\nUsing the Tools and Techniques of Qualitative Risk Analysis\\n\\nThe Qualitative Risk Analysis process’s tools and techniques are primarily concerned with dis- covering the probability of a risk event and determining the impact (or consequences) the risk will have if it does occur. The output of this process is a risk register update where you’ll doc- ument the prioritized risks you’ve scored using these tools and techniques. All of the informa- tion you gather regarding risks and probability needs to be as accurate as possible.

You’ll use the tools and techniques of this process to establish risk scores, which is a way of categorizing the probability and risk impact. The Qualitative Risk Analysis process includes the following tools and techniques:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRisk probability and impact assessment\\n\\nProbability and impact matrix\\n\\nRisk data quality assessment\\n\\nRisk categorization\\n\\nRisk urgency assessment\\n\\nWe’ll look at each of these tools and techniques next.\\n\\nRisk Probability and Impact Assessment\\n\\nThis tool and technique assess the probability that the risk events you’ve identified will occur and it determines the effect their impacts have on the project objectives, including time, scope, quality, and cost. Analyzing risks in this way allows you to determine which risks require the most aggressive management. When determining probabilities and impacts, you’ll refer back to the risk management plan element called “definitions of risk probability and impact.”\\n\\nProbability\\n\\nProbability is the likelihood that an event will occur. The classic example is flipping a coin. There is a .50 probability of getting heads and a .50 probability of getting tails on the flip. One thing to note is that the probability that an event will occur plus the probability that the event will not occur always equals 1.0. In this coin-flipping example, there is a .50 chance that you’ll get heads on the flip. There is also, therefore, a .50 chance you will not get heads on the flip. The two responses added together equal 1.0. Probability is expressed as a number from 0.0—which means there is no probability of the event occurring—to 1.0—which means there is 100 percent certainty the risk will occur.\\n\\nDetermining risk probability can be difficult because it’s most commonly accomplished using expert judgment. In non-PMP terms, this means you’re guessing (or asking other experts to guess) at the probability a risk event will occur. Granted, you’re basing your guess on past experiences with similar projects or risk events, but no two risk events (or projects) are ever the same. It’s best to fully develop the criteria for determining probability and get as many experts involved as you can. Carefully weigh their responses to come up with the best probability values possible.\\n\\nImpact\\n\\nImpact is the amount of pain (or the amount of gain) the risk event poses to the project. The risk impact scale can be a relative scale that assigns values such as high-medium-low (or some com- bination of these) or a numeric scale known as a cardinal scale. Cardinal scale values are actual numeric values assigned to the risk impact. Cardinal scales are expressed as values from 0.0 to 1.0 and may be stated in equal (linear) or unequal (nonlinear) increments.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 184  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n184\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nTable 5.1 shows a typical risk impact scale for cost, time, and quality objectives based on a high-high to low-low scale. You’ll notice that each of the “high-medium-low” value combina- tions on this impact scale have been assigned a cardinal value. We’ll use these in the next section when we talk about the probability and impact matrix.\\n\\nT A B L E 5 . 1\\n\\nRisk Impacts Scale\\n\\nObjectives\\n\\nLow\\n\\n\\n\\nLow\\n\\nCost\\n\\nTime\\n\\n0.05\\n\\nNo significant\\n\\nimpact\\n\\nNo significant\\n\\nimpact\\n\\nQuality\\n\\nNo significant\\n\\nimpact\\n\\nLow\\n\\n0.20\\n\\nLess\\n\\nthan 6%\\n\\nincrease\\n\\nLess than\\n\\n6%\\n\\nincrease\\n\\nFew com\\n\\n\\n\\nponents\\n\\nimpacted\\n\\nMedium\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nHigh\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh\\n\\n0.40\\n\\n0.60\\n\\n0.80\\n\\n7–12%\\n\\nincrease\\n\\n13–18%\\n\\nincrease\\n\\n7–12%\\n\\nincrease\\n\\n13–18%\\n\\nincrease\\n\\nMore than\\n\\n18%\\n\\nincrease\\n\\nMore than\\n\\n18%\\n\\nincrease\\n\\nUnaccept\\n\\n\\n\\nable quality\\n\\nProduct not\\n\\nusable\\n\\nSignificant\\n\\nimpact requir\\n\\n\\n\\ning customer\\n\\napproval to\\n\\nproceed\\n\\nWhen you’re using a high-medium-low scale it’s important that your risk team understands what criteria was used to determine a high score versus a medium or low score and how these should be applied to the project objectives.\\n\\nAssessing Probability and Impact\\n\\nThe idea behind both probability and impact values is to develop predefined measurements that describe what value to place on a risk event.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, don’t forget that you defined probability and impact values during the Risk Man- agement Planning process.\\n\\nIf these scales have not yet been determined, develop them as early on in the project as pos- sible. You can use any of the techniques we talked about earlier in the section “Tools and Tech- niques Used to Identify Risk,” such as brainstorming or the Delphi technique, to come up with the values for probability and impact.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 185  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nAnalyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques\\n\\n185\\n\\nDuring the Qualitative Risk Analysis process, you’ll determine and assess probability and impact for every risk identified during the Risk Identification process. You could interview or hold meetings with project team members, subject matter experts, stakeholder or others to help assess these factors. During this process, you should document not only the probability and impact but also the assumptions your team members used to arrive at these determinations. The next technique—probability and impact matrix—take the probability and impact values one step further by assigning an overall risk score.\\n\\nProbability and Impact Matrix\\n\\nA probability and impact matrix assigns an overall risk rating to each of the project’s identified risks. The combination of probability and impact results in a classification usually expressed as high, medium, or low. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, high risks are considered a red condition, medium risks are considered a yellow condition, and low risks are considered a green condition. This type of ranking is known as an ordinal scale because the values are rank-ordered from high to low. (In practice, ordinal values may also include ranking by position. In other words, the risks are listed in rank order as the first, the second, the third, and so on.)\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK notes that the probability and impact matrix values are usually set by the organization and are a part of the organizational process assets.\\n\\nNow let’s look at an example. You have identified a risk event that could impact project costs, and your experts believe costs could increase by as much as 9 percent. According to the risk impact rating matrix in Table 5.1, this risk carries a medium impact, with a value of 0.40. Hold onto that number because you’re going to plug it into the probability impact matrix— along with the probability value—to determine an overall risk value next.\\n\\nYou’ll remember from our discussion previously that probability values should be assigned num- bers from 0.0 to 1.0. In this example, the team has determined that there is a 0.2 probability of this risk event occurring. The risk impact scale shows a medium or 0.4 impact should the event occur. Now, to determine whether the combination of the probability and impact of this risk is high, medium, or low, you’ll need to check the probability impact matrix. Table 5.2 shows a sample probability and impact matrix.\\n\\nFirst look at the probability column. Your risk event has a probability of .2. Now follow that row until you find the impact score of .04. According to your probability and impact matrix val- ues, this risk carries a score of 0.08 and falls in the low threshold, so this risk is assigned a low (or green condition) value.\\n\\nThe values assigned to the risks determine how Risk Response Planning is carried out for the\\n\\nrisks later during the risk-planning processes. Obviously, risks with high probability and high\\n\\n3601.book  Page 186  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n186\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nimpact are going to need further analysis and formal responses. Remember that the values for this matrix (and the probability and impact scales discussed earlier) are determined prior to the start of this process and documented in the Risk Management Plan. Also keep in mind that probability and impact do not have to be assigned the same values as I’ve done here. You may use 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 for probability, for example, and assign .05, 0.1, .03, 0.5, and 0.7 for impact scales.\\n\\nT A B L E 5 . 2\\n\\nSample Probability and Impact Matrix\\n\\nProbability\\n\\n.8\\n\\n.6\\n\\n.4\\n\\n.2\\n\\nImpact\\n\\nValues\\n\\n\\n\\n.05\\n\\n.04\\n\\n.03\\n\\n.02\\n\\n.01\\n\\n.20\\n\\n.16\\n\\n.12\\n\\n.08\\n\\n.04\\n\\n.40\\n\\n.32\\n\\n.24\\n\\n.16\\n\\n.08\\n\\n.60\\n\\n.48\\n\\n.36\\n\\n.24\\n\\n.12\\n\\n.80\\n\\n.64\\n\\n.48\\n\\n.32\\n\\n.16\\n\\nThe legend for the PI matrix is as follows: no formatting = low assignment or green condition; bold = medium as-\\n\\nsignment or yellow condition; bold italic = high assignment or red condition.\\n\\nT A B L E 5 . 3\\n\\nPI Matrix for Screen Scrapers, Inc.\\n\\nProbability\\n\\n.8\\n\\n.6\\n\\n.4\\n\\n.2\\n\\nImpact\\n\\nScores\\n\\n\\n\\n.05\\n\\n.04\\n\\n.03\\n\\n.02\\n\\n.01\\n\\n.20\\n\\n.16\\n\\n.12\\n\\n.08\\n\\n.04\\n\\n.40\\n\\n.32\\n\\n.24\\n\\n.16\\n\\n.08\\n\\n.60\\n\\n.48\\n\\n.36\\n\\n.24\\n\\n.12\\n\\n.80\\n\\n.64\\n\\n.48\\n\\n.32\\n\\n.16\\n\\nThe legend for the PI matrix is as follows: no formatting = low assignment or green condition; bold = medium as-\\n\\nsignment or yellow condition; bold italic = high assignment or red condition.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 187  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nAnalyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques\\n\\n187\\n\\nScreen Scrapers, Inc.\\n\\nScreen Scrapers is a software-manufacturing company that produces a software product that looks at your mainframe screens, commonly called green screens, and converts them to browser-based screens. The browser-based screens look like any other Windows-compatible screens with buttons, scroll bars, and drop-down lists.\\n\\nScreen Scrapers devised this product for companies that use mainframe programs to update and store data because many of the entry-level workers beginning their careers today are not familiar with green screens. They’re cumbersome and difficult to learn, and no consistency exists from screen to screen or program to program. An F5 key in one program might mean go back one page, while an F5 key in another program might mean clear the screen. New users are easily confused, make a lot of mistakes, and have to write tablets full of notes on how to navigate all the screens.\\n\\nYour company has purchased the Screen Scraper product and has appointed you the project manager over the installation. There are lots of issues to address on this project, and you’ve made great headway. You’re now at the risk identification and qualitative risk analysis stage. You decide to use the Delphi technique to assist you in identifying risk and assigning probability and impact rankings. There are some experts available in your company who can serve on the Delphi panel, as well as some folks in industry organizations you belong to outside the company.\\n\\nYou assemble the group, and set up a summary of the project and send it out via e-mail, request- ing responses to your questions about risk. After the first pass, you compile the list of risks as fol- lows (this list is an example and isn’t exhaustive because your list will be project specific):\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nVendor viability—will the software company stay in business?\\n\\nVendor responsiveness with problems after implementation\\n\\nSoftware compatibility risks with existing systems\\n\\nHardware compatibility risk\\n\\nConnection to the mainframe risk\\n\\nTraining IT staff members to maintain the product\\n\\nYou send this list back to the Delphi members and ask them to assign a probability of 0.0–1.0 and an impact of high-high, high, medium, low, or low-low to each risk. The Delphi members assign probability and impact based on a probability scale and an impact scale designed by the risk management team. The values of the impact scale are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nHigh\\n\\n\\n\\nhigh = 0.8\\n\\nHigh = 0.6\\n\\n3601.book  Page 188  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n188\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\n(cid:2) Medium = 0.4\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nLow = 0.2\\n\\nLow\\n\\n\\n\\nlow = 0.05\\n\\nThe team sends you back the following probability and impact values:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nVendor viability = .6 probability, high impact\\n\\nVendor responsiveness = .4 probability, medium impact\\n\\nSoftware compatibility = .4 probability, medium impact\\n\\nHardware compatibility = .6 probability, high-high impact\\n\\n(cid:2) Mainframe connection = .2 probability, high-high impact\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTraining = .2 probability, low-low impact\\n\\nThe probability and impact matrix you used to assign the overall risk scores were derived from the probability and impact matrix shown in Table 5.3.\\n\\nBased on the probability and impact matrix thresholds, the project risks are assigned the fol- lowing overall probabilities:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nVendor viability = high\\n\\nVendor responsiveness = medium\\n\\nSoftware compatibility = medium\\n\\nHardware compatibility = high\\n\\n(cid:2) Mainframe connection = high\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTraining = low\\n\\nRisk Data Quality Assessment\\n\\nThe data quality assessment involves determining the usefulness of the data gathered to evaluate risk. Most importantly, the data must be unbiased and accurate. You will want to examine ele- ments like the following when performing this tool and technique:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe quality of the data used\\n\\nThe availability of data regarding the risks\\n\\n(cid:2) How well the risk is understood\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe reliability and integrity of the data\\n\\nThe accuracy of the data\\n\\n3601.book  Page 189  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nAnalyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques\\n\\n189\\n\\nLow-quality data will render the Qualitative Risk Analysis process’s findings almost useless. Spend the time to validate and verify the information you’ve collected about risks so that your prioritization and analysis is as accurate as it can be. If you find that the quality of the data is questionable, you guessed it, go back and get better data.\\n\\nRisk Categorizations\\n\\nThis tool and technique is used to determine the effects risk has on the project. You can examine not only the categories of risk determined during the Risk Management Planning process (and described in the RBS) but also the project phase and the WBS to determine the elements of the project that are affected by risk.\\n\\nRisk Urgency Assessment\\n\\nUsing this tool you’ll determine how soon the potential risks may occur and quickly determine responses for those risks that could occur soon. You should consider the risk triggers, the time to develop and implement a response, and the overall risk rating when determining how quickly responses are needed.\\n\\nRanking Risks in the Risk Register\\n\\nThe goal of the Qualitative Risk Analysis process is to rank the risks and determine which ones need further analysis and, eventually, risk response plans. The output of this process is risk register updates. As you can probably guess, you’ll update the register with the following information:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRisk ranking (or priority) for the identified risks\\n\\nRisks grouped by categories\\n\\nList of risks requiring near-term responses\\n\\nList of risks for additional analysis and response\\n\\n(cid:2) Watch list of low-priority risks\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTrends in Qualitative Risk Analysis results\\n\\nEach of these elements become new entries in the risk register. For example, risk ranking assigns the risk score or priority you determined using the probability and impact matrix to the list of identified risks previously recorded in the risk register. We’ve discussed the categories and the list of risks requiring near-term responses earlier. Note these in the risk register.\\n\\nYou’ll also note those risks that require further analysis (including using the Quantitative Risk Analysis process), you’ll create a list of risks that have low risk scores to review periodi- cally, and you should note any trends in qualitative risk analysis that become evident as you per- form this process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 190  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n190\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nQuantifying Risk\\n\\nThe Quantitative Risk Analysis process evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized during the Qual- itative Risk Analysis process and quantifies risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric probabilities to each risk and their impacts on project objectives. This quantitative approach is accomplished using techniques like Monte Carlo simulation and decision tree analysis. To para- phrase A Guide to the PMBOK, the purpose of this process is to perform the following:\\n\\n(cid:2) Quantify the project’s possible outcomes and probabilities.\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDetermine the probability of achieving the project objectives.\\n\\nIdentify risks that need the most attention by quantifying their contribution to overall project risk.\\n\\nIdentify realistic and achievable schedule, cost, or scope targets.\\n\\nDetermine the best project management decisions possible when outcomes are uncertain.\\n\\nQuantitative Risk Analysis—like Qualitative Risk Analysis—examines each risk and its potential impact on the project objectives. You may choose to use both of these processes to assess risk or only one of them, depending on the complexity of the project and the organiza- tional policy regarding risk planning. The Quantitative Risk Analysis process can follow either the Risk Identification process or the Qualitative Risk Analysis process. If you do use this pro- cess, be certain to repeat it every time the Risk Response Planning process is performed and as part of the Risk Monitoring and Control process.\\n\\nWe have already covered many of the inputs to the Quantitative Risk Analysis process in pre-\\n\\nvious sections of this chapter. They are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nRisk management plan\\n\\nRisk register\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nThe elements of the project management plan you’ll want to pay close attention to as an input to this process are the project schedule management plan and the project cost manage- ment plan.\\n\\nQuantitative Risk Analysis Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThere are two sets of tools and techniques for the Quantitative Risk Analysis process: data gath- ering and representation techniques, and quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques. Each of these sets of techniques include three techniques that we’ll examine next.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 191  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nQuantifying Risk\\n\\n191\\n\\nData Gathering and Representation Techniques\\n\\nThe data gathering techniques includes interviewing techniques, probability distributions, and expert judgment. Let’s look at each of them.\\n\\nInterviewing\\n\\nThis technique is like the interviewing technique discussed earlier in the section “Identifying Potential Risk.” Project team members, stakeholders, and subject matter experts are prime can- didates for risk interviews. Ask them about their experiences on past projects and about work- ing with the types of technology or processes you’ll use during this project.\\n\\nFor the exam, remember that interviewing is a tool and technique of the Quan- titative Risk Analysis process. Although you can use this technique in the Risk Identification process, it isn’t an “official” tool and technique of that process.\\n\\nWhen using this technique, you should first determine what methods of probability distribu- tion (described next) you’ll use to analyze your information. The technique you chose will dictate the type of information you need to gather. For example, you might use a three-point scale that assess the optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely risk scenarios or take it a step further and use standard deviations calculations. We’ll talk more about three-point estimates in Chapter 7.\\n\\nMake certain you document how the interviewees decided upon the risk ranges, the criteria they used to place risks in certain categories, and the results of the interview. This will help you later in developing risk responses as well.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, you should know that there are several types of probability distributions that are useful in determining and displaying risk information. The type of distribution you use deter- mines the type of information you should gather during the interviewing process.\\n\\nProbability Distributions\\n\\nIt’s beyond the scope of this book to delve into probability distributions and calculations, so I’ll point out a few things you should remember for the exam regarding them.\\n\\nContinuous probability distributions (particularly beta and triangular distributions) are commonly used in Quantitative Risk Analysis. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, contin- uous probability distributions include normal, lognormal, triangular, beta, and uniform distri- butions. Distributions are graphically displayed and represent both the probability and time or cost elements.\\n\\nTriangular distributions use estimates based on the three-point estimate (the pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic values). This means that during your interviews, you’ll gather these pieces of information from your experts. Then you’ll use them to quantify risk for each WBS element.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 192  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n192\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nNormal and lognormal distributions use mean and standard deviations to quantify risk,\\n\\nwhich also require gathering the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates.\\n\\nExpert Judgment\\n\\nWe’ve talked about this tool and technique before. Experts can come from inside or outside the organization and should have experience that’s applicable to your project. For example, if your project involves manufacturing a new product or part, you might want to consider experts like engineers or statisticians. If you’re dealing with sensitive data in an information technology project, consider bringing on a security expert.\\n\\nQuantitative Risk Analysis and Modeling Techniques\\n\\nThere are four techniques encompassed in this tool and technique: sensitivity analysis, expected monetary value analysis, decision tree analysis, and modeling and simulation. Let’s take a brief look at each of them.\\n\\nSensitivity Analysis\\n\\nSensitivity analysis is a quantitative method of analyzing the potential impact of risk events on the project and determining which risk event (or events) has the greatest potential for impact by examining all the uncertain elements at their baseline values. One of the ways sensitivity anal- ysis data is displayed is a tornado diagram. Figure 5.5 shows a sample tornado diagram.\\n\\nF I G U R E 5 . 5\\n\\nTornado diagram\\n\\nTechnical risk\\n\\nQuality risk\\n\\nProject management risk\\n\\nOrganizational risk\\n\\n12,000\\n\\n6,000\\n\\n0\\n\\n6,000\\n\\n12,000\\n\\nProject budget\\n\\nYou can see by the arrangement of horizontal bars (each representing a sensitivity variable) how the diagram gets its name. The idea is that each sensitivity bar displays the low and high value possible for that element. (It’s beyond the scope of this book to explain how these values are deter- mined. The questions you may encounter on the exam are focused on the context of this type of analysis.) The variables with the greatest effect on the project are displayed at the top of the graph and decrease in impact as you progress down through the graph. This gives you a quick overview of how much the project can be affected by uncertainty in the various elements. It also allows you to see at a glance which risks may have the biggest impacts on the project and will require carefully\\n\\n3601.book  Page 193  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nQuantifying Risk\\n\\n193\\n\\ncrafted, detailed response plans. You can use tornado diagrams to determine sensitivity in cost, time, and quality objectives or for risks you’ve identified during this process.\\n\\nSensitivity analysis can also be used to determine stakeholder risk tolerance levels.\\n\\nExpected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis\\n\\nExpected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical technique that calculates the average, anticipated impact of the decision. EMV is calculated by multiplying the probability of the risk times its impact and then adding them together. EMV is used in conjunction with the decision tree analysis technique, which is covered next. I’ll give you an example of the EMV formula in the next section. Positive results generally mean the risks you’re assessing pose opportunities to the project while negative results generally indicate a threat to the project.\\n\\nDecision Tree Analysis\\n\\nUnfortunately, this isn’t a tree outside your office door that produces “Yes” and “No” leaves that you can pick to help you make a decision. Decision trees are diagrams that show the sequence of interrelated decisions and the expected results of choosing one alternative over the other. Typically, more than one choice or option is available when you’re faced with a decision or, in this case, potential outcomes from a risk event. The available choices are depicted in a tree form starting at the left with the risk decision branching out to the right with possible outcomes. Decision trees are usually used for risk events associated with time or cost.\\n\\nFigure 5.6 shows a sample decision tree using expected monetary value (EMV) as one of\\n\\nits inputs.\\n\\nThe expected monetary value of the decision is a result of the probability of the risk event multiplied by the impact and then adding their results. The squares in this figure represent deci- sions to be made, and the circles represent the points where risk events may occur.\\n\\nF I G U R E 5 . 6\\n\\nDecision tree\\n\\nDecision/\\n\\nStart\\n\\nChoice X\\n\\nEMV = $7000\\n\\nChoice Y\\n\\nEMV = $5000\\n\\nExpected Value\\n\\nof Decision\\n\\n$4200\\n\\n$2800\\n\\n$4000\\n\\n$1000\\n\\nGood Outcome\\n\\nProbability .6\\n\\nPoor Outcome\\n\\nProbability .4\\n\\nGood Outcome\\n\\nProbability .8\\n\\nPoor Outcome\\n\\nProbability .2\\n\\n3601.book  Page 194  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n194\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nThe decision with an expected value of $7,000 is the correct decision to make because the\\n\\nresulting outcome has the greatest value.\\n\\nModeling and Simulation\\n\\nModeling and simulation techniques are often used for schedule risk analysis and cost analysis. For example, modeling allows you to translate the potential risks at specific points in the project into their impacts so you can determine how the project objectives are affected. Simulation tech- niques compute the project model using various inputs such as cost or schedule duration, to determine a probability distribution for the variable chosen. (Cost risks typically use either a work breakdown structure or cost breakdown structure as the input variable. Schedule risks always use the precedence diagramming method as the input variable. We we’ll cover schedule diagramming methods in Chapter 7.) If you used simulation techniques to determine project cost and use the cost of the project elements as the input variable, a probability distribution for the total cost of the project would be produced after running the simulation numerous times. Modeling and simulation techniques examine the identified risks and their potential impacts to the project objectives from the perspective of the whole project.\\n\\nMonte Carlo analysis is an example of a simulation technique. Monte Carlo analysis is per-\\n\\nformed many times, typically using cost or schedule variables. Every time the analysis is per- formed, the values for the variable are changed using a probability distribution for each variable. Monte Carlo analysis can also be used during the Schedule Development process.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, simulation techniques are recommended for predicting schedule or cost risks because they’re more powerful then EMV and less likely to be misused. For the exam, remember that simulation techniques are used to predict schedule or cost risks. Schedule simulations are usually performed using the precedence diagramming method, while cost simulation typically uses the WBS as its basis.\\n\\nQuantitative Risk Analysis Outputs\\n\\nThe output of the Quantitative Risk Analysis process is—I’ll bet you can guess—risk register updates. As with the Qualitative Risk Analysis process, there are new elements you’ll record in the risk register:\\n\\nProbabilistic analysis of the project Probabilistic analysis of the project is the forecasted results of the project schedule and costs as determined by the outcomes of risk analysis. These results include projected completion dates and costs, along with a confidence level associated with each. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, this output is often expressed as a cumulative distribution and you’ll use these results along with stakeholder risk tolerances to quantify the time and cost contingency reserves. (We’ll talk about contingency reserves in the section “Developing a Risk Response Plan” later in this chapter.)\\n\\n3601.book  Page 195  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping a Risk Response Plan\\n\\n195\\n\\nConfidence levels can also be used to describe the level of confidence placed on the outcome of the forecasted results. For example, suppose the projected schedule completion date is July 12 and the confidence level is .85. This says that you believe the project will finish on or before July 12 and that you have an 85 percent level of confidence that this date is accurate.\\n\\nProbability of achieving the cost and time objectives Using the tools and techniques of Quan- titative Risk Analysis allows you to assign a probability of achieving the cost and time objectives of the project. This output documents those probabilities and as such requires a thorough understanding of the current project objectives and knowledge of the risks.\\n\\nPrioritized lists of quantified risks The prioritized list in this process is similar to the list pro- duced during the Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The list of risks includes those that present the greatest risk or threat to the project and their impacts. It also lists those risks that present the greatest opportunities to the project. This list should also indicate which risks are most likely to impact the critical path and those that have the largest cost contingency.\\n\\nTrends in Quantitative Risk Analysis results Trends in Quantitative Risk Analysis will likely appear as you repeat the risk analysis processes. This information is useful as you progress, making those risks with the greatest threat to the project more evident, which allows you the opportunity to perform further analysis or go on to develop risk response plans.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand the differences between the Qualitative Risk Analysis and Quantitative Risk Anal- ysis processes for the exam.\\n\\nDeveloping a Risk Response Plan\\n\\nThe Risk Response Planning process is the last process covered in this chapter. (I hear you cheer- ing out there!) Risk Response Planning is a process of deciding what actions to take to reduce threats and take advantage of the opportunities discovered during the risk analysis processes. This process also includes assigning departments or individual staff members the responsibility of carrying out the risk response plans you’ll outline in this process. These folks are known as risk owners.\\n\\nThe more effective your risk response plans are, the better your chances for a successful project. Well-developed and well-written risk response plans will decrease overall project risk.\\n\\nGenerally, you’ll want to develop risk response plans for those risks with a combination of high probability of occurrence and significant impact to the project. Developing risk response\\n\\n3601.book  Page 196  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n196\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nplans for risks of low severity or insignificant impact is not efficient or a good use of the project team’s time. Spend your time planning responses that are appropriate given the impact the risk itself poses (or the opportunity the risk presents) and don’t spend more time, money, or energy to produce a response than the risk event itself would produce if it occurred.\\n\\nSeveral strategies are used in this process to reduce or control risk. It’s important that you choose the right strategy for each risk so that the risk and its impacts are dealt with effectively. After deciding on which strategy to use, you’ll develop an action plan to put this strategy into play should the risk event occur. You may also choose to designate a secondary or backup strategy.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe severity of the risk will dictate the level of risk response planning that should be performed. For example, a risk with low severity wouldn’t warrant the time it takes to develop a detailed risk response plan. Risk responses should be cost effective—if the cost of the response is more than the consequences of the risk, you might want to examine a different risk response. Risk responses should also be timely, agreed to by all the project stakeholders, and assigned to an individual (risk owner) who is responsible for monitoring and carrying out the risk response plan if needed.\\n\\nRisk Response Planning Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThere are four tools and techniques for the Risk Response Planning process and each one of them involves a strategy. The tools and techniques are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nStrategies for negative risks or threats\\n\\nStrategies for positive risks or opportunities\\n\\nStrategies for both threats and opportunities\\n\\nContingence response strategy\\n\\nWe’ll take a look at each.\\n\\nStrategies for Negative Risks or Threats\\n\\nThere are three strategies to deal with negative risks or threats to the project objectives. They are avoid, transfer, and mitigate.\\n\\nAvoid\\n\\nTo avoid a risk means you’ll evade it altogether, eliminate the cause of the risk event, or change the project plan to protect the project objectives from the risk event. Let’s say you’re going to take a car trip from your home to a point 800 miles away. You know—because your friends who just took the same trip told you—that there is a long stretch of construction on one of the highways you’re planning on using. To avoid the risk of delay, you plan the trip around the construction work and use another highway for that stretch of driving. In this way, you change your plans, avoid the risk of getting held up in construction traffic, and arrive at your destination on time.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 197  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping a Risk Response Plan\\n\\n197\\n\\nWith risk avoidance, you essentially eradicate the risk by eliminating its cause. Here’s another example: Suppose your project was kicked off without adequate scope definition and requirements gathering. You run a high probability of experiencing scope creep—ever-changing requirements—as the project progresses, thus impacting the project schedule. You can avoid this risk by adequately documenting the project scope and requirements during the Planning processes and taking steps to monitor and control changes to scope so it doesn’t get out of hand. Risks that occur early in the project might easily be avoided by improving communications, refining requirements, assigning additional resources to project activities, refining the project scope to avoid risk events, and so on.\\n\\nTransfer\\n\\nThe idea behind a risk transfer is to transfer the risk and the consequences of that risk to a third party. The risk hasn’t gone away, but the responsibility for the management of that risk now rests with another party. Most companies aren’t willing to take on someone else’s risk without a little cash thrown in for good measure. This strategy will impact the project budget and should be included in the cost estimate exercises if you know you’re going to use it.\\n\\nTransfer of risk can occur in many forms but is most effective when dealing with financial\\n\\nrisks. Insurance is one form of risk transfer. You are probably familiar with how insurance works. Car insurance is a good example. You purchase car insurance so that if you come upon an obstacle in the road and there is no way to avoid hitting it, the cost to repair the damage to the car is paid by the insurance company. Okay, minus the deductible and all the calculations for the age of the car, the mileage, the color and make of the car, the weather conditions the day you were driving—but I digress.\\n\\nAnother method of risk transfer is contracting. Contracting transfers specific risks to the ven- dor, depending on the work required by the contract. The vendor accepts the responsibility for the cost of failure. Again, this doesn’t come without a price. Contractors charge for their ser- vices, and depending on the type of contract you negotiate, the cost might be quite high. For example, in a fixed-price contract, which we’ll talk more about in the Procurement Planning section, the vendor (or seller) increases the cost of the contract to compensate for the level of risk they’re accepting. A cost reimbursable contract, however, leaves the majority of the risk with you, the buyer. This type of contract may reduce costs if there are project changes midway through the project.\\n\\nKeep in mind that contracting isn’t a cure-all. You might just be swapping one risk for another. For example, say you hire a driver to go with you on your road trip and their job is to do all the driving. If the driver becomes ill or in some way can’t fulfill their obligation, you aren’t going to get to your destination on time. You’ve placed the risks associated with the drive on the contract driver; however, you’ve taken on a risk of delay due to nonperformance, which means you’ve just swapped one risk for another. You’ll have to weigh your options in cases like this and determine which side of the risk coin your organization can more readily accept. Other forms of transference include warranties, guarantees, and performance bonds.\\n\\nMitigate\\n\\nWhen you mitigate a risk, you attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event and its impacts to an acceptable level. This strategy is a lot like defensive driving. You see an obstacle in the road\\n\\n3601.book  Page 198  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n198\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nahead, survey your options, and take the necessary steps to avoid the obstacle and proceed safely on your journey. Seeing the obstacle ahead (identifying risk) allows you to reduce the threat by planning ways around it or planning ways to reduce its impact if the risk does occur (mitigation strategies).\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. It’s easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of a risk or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it’s occurred. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less-complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand all of the strategies and their characteristics in each tool and technique for the exam.\\n\\nStrategies for Positive Risk or Opportunities\\n\\nThere are three strategies for dealing with opportunities or positive risks that may present them- selves on the project: exploit, share, and enhance.\\n\\nExploit\\n\\nWhen you exploit a risk event, you’re looking for opportunities for positive impacts. This is the strategy of choice when you’ve identified positive risks that you want to make certain will occur on the project. Examples of exploiting a risk include reducing the amount of time to complete the project by bringing on more qualified resources or by providing even better quality than originally planned.\\n\\nShare\\n\\nThe share strategy is similar to transferring because you’ll assign the risk to a third-party owner who is best able to bring about the opportunity the risk event presents. For example, perhaps what your organization does best is investing. However, it isn’t so good at marketing. Forming a joint venture with a marketing firm to capitalize on a positive risk will make the most of the opportunities.\\n\\nEnhance\\n\\nThe enhance strategy closely watches the probability and or impact of the risk event to assure that the organization realizes the benefits. This entails watching for and emphasizing risk trig- gers and identifying the root causes of the risk to help enhance impacts or probability.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 199  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping a Risk Response Plan\\n\\n199\\n\\nStrategies for Both Threats and Opportunities\\n\\nThe third tool and technique of the Risk Response Planning process, strategies for both threats and opportunities, is called the acceptance strategy. Acceptance of a risk event is a strategy that can be used for risks that pose either threats or opportunities to the project. Passive acceptance is a strategy that means that you won’t make any plans to try to avoid or mitigate the risk. You’re willing to accept the consequences of the risk should it occur. Acceptance may also mean the project team was unable to come up with an adequate response strategy and must accept the risk and its consequences. Active acceptance may include developing contingency reserves to deal with risks should they occur. (We’ll look at contingency reserves in the next section.)\\n\\nLet’s revisit the road trip example. You could plan the trip using the original route and just accept the risk of running into construction. If you get to that point and you’re delayed, you’ll just accept it. This is passive acceptance. You could also go ahead and make plans to take an alternate route but not enact those plans until you actually reach the construction and know for certain that it is going to impede your progress. This is active acceptance and may involve developing a contingency plan.\\n\\nContingency Planning\\n\\nThe last tool and technique of the Risk Response Planning process is called the contingent response strategy, better known as contingency planning. Contingency planning involves planning alterna- tives to deal with the risks should they occur. This is different than mitigation planning in that mit- igation looks to reduce the probability of the risk and its impact whereas contingency planning doesn’t necessarily attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event or its impacts. Contingency plan- ning says the risk may very well occur and we better have plans in place to deal with it.\\n\\nContingency comes into play when the risk event occurs. This implies you need to plan for your contingencies well in advance of the threat. After the risks have been identified and quan- tified, contingency plans should be developed and kept at the ready.\\n\\nContingency allowances or reserves are a common contingency response. Contingency reserves include project funds that are held in reserve to offset any unavoidable threats that might occur to project scope, schedule, cost, or quality. It also includes reserving time and resources to account for risks. You should consider stakeholder risk tolerances when determin- ing the amount of contingency reserves.\\n\\nFallback plans should be developed for risks with high impact or for risks with identified\\n\\nstrategies that may not be the most effective.\\n\\nIn practice, you’ll find that identifying, prioritizing, quantifying, and developing responses for potential threats may happen simultaneously. In any case, you don’t want to be taken by surprise, and that’s the point of the risk processes. If you know about potential risks early on, you can very often mitigate them or prepare appropriate response plans or contingency plans to deal with them.\\n\\nRisk Response Planning Outputs\\n\\nAs you’ve no doubt concluded, the purpose of the Risk Response Planning process is to develop risk responses for those risks with the highest probability and impact on the project objectives. There are three outputs of the Risk Response Planning process: risk register updates, project management plan updates, and risk-related contractual agreements.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 200  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n200\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nRemember that you might need to revisit other Planning processes after per- forming Risk Response Planning to modify project plans as a result of risk responses.\\n\\nRisk Register Updates\\n\\nAgain, the risk register is updated at the end of this process with the information you’ve dis- covered during this process. The response plans are recorded in the risk register. You’ll recall that the risk register lists the risk in order of priority (those with the highest potential for threat or opportunity first), so it makes sense that the response plans you have for these risks will be more detailed than the remaining lists. Some risks may not require response plans at all, but you should put them on a watch list and monitor them throughout the project.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at what the risk register should contain at this point. According to A Guide\\n\\nto the PMBOK, after Risk Identification, Qualitative Risk Analysis, and Quantitative Risk Analysis are preformed, the following elements should appear in the risk register:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nList of identified risks, including their descriptions, what WBS element they impact (or area of the project), categories (RBS), root causes, and how the risk impacts the project objectives\\n\\nRisk owners and their responsibility\\n\\nRisk triggers\\n\\nResponse plans and strategies, including the steps to take to implement the strategy\\n\\nCost and schedule activities needed to implement risk responses\\n\\nContingency reserves for cost and time\\n\\nContingency plans\\n\\nFallback plans\\n\\nList of residual and secondary risks\\n\\nProbabilistic analysis of the project and other outputs of the Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis processes\\n\\nThe only elements in the preceding list we haven’t talked about so far are residual and sec-\\n\\nondary risks. A residual risk is a leftover risk so to speak. After you’ve implemented a risk response strategy—say mitigation, for example—some minor risk may still remain. The contin- gency reserve is set up to handle situations like this.\\n\\nSecondary risks are risks that come about as a result of implementing a risk response. The example given previously where you transferred risk by hiring a driver to take you to your des- tination but they became ill along the way is an example of a secondary risk. Their illness delayed your arrival time, which is risk directly caused by hiring the driver or implementing a risk response. When planning for risk, identify and plan responses for secondary risks that could occur as well.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 201  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping a Risk Response Plan\\n\\n201\\n\\nRisk\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Contractual Agreements\\n\\nIf you’re planning on using strategies such as transference or sharing, for example, you may need to purchase services or items from third parties. The contracts for those services can be pre- pared now and discussed with the appropriate parties.\\n\\nRisks exist on all projects, and risk planning is an important part of the project Planning pro- cesses. Just the act of identifying risks and planning responses can decrease their impact if they occur. Don’t take the “What I don’t know won’t hurt me” approach to risk planning. This is def- initely a case where not knowing something can be devastating. Risks that are easily identified and have planned responses aren’t likely to kill projects or your career. Risks that you should have known about but ignored could end up costing the organization thousands or millions of dollars, causing schedule delays, or ultimately killing the project. There could be a personal cost as well, as cost and schedule overruns due to poor planning on your part are not easily explained.\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nRicardo knocks on your office door and asks if you have a few minutes to talk. “Of course,” you reply, and he takes a seat on one of the comfy chairs at the conference table. You have a feeling this might take a while.\\n\\n“I think you should know that I’m concerned about the availability of the T1 line. I’ve already put in the call to get us on the list because, as I said last week, there’s a 30- to 45-day lead time on these orders.”\\n\\n“We’re only midway through the Planning processes. Do you need to order the T1 so soon? We don’t even know the store location yet,” you say.\\n\\n“Even though they say lead time is 30 to 45 days, I’ve waited as much as five or six months to get a T1 installed in the past. I know we’re really pushing for the early February store opening, so I thought I’d get the ball rolling now. What I need from you is the location address, and I’ll need that pretty quick.”\\n\\n“We’re narrowing down the choices between a couple of properties, so I should have that for you within the next couple of weeks. Is that soon enough?”\\n\\n“The sooner the better,” Ricardo replies.\\n\\n“Great. I’m glad you stopped by, Ricardo. I wanted to talk with you about risk anyway, and you led us right into the discussion. Let me ask you, what probability would you assign to the T1 line installation happening six months from now?”\\n\\n“I’d say the probability for six months is low. It’s more likely that if there is a delay, it would be within a three- to four-month time frame.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 202  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n202\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\n“If they didn’t get to it for six months, would it be a showstopper? In other words, is there some other way we could transfer Jill’s data until the T1 did get installed?”\\n\\n“Sure, there are other methods we could use. Jill won’t want to do that for very long, but there are workarounds available.”\\n\\n“Good. Now, what about the risk for contractor availability and hardware availability and deliv- ery schedules?” you ask.\\n\\nYou and Ricardo go on to discuss the risks associated with the IT tasks. Later, you ask Jill and Jake the same kinds of questions and compile a list of risks. In addition, you review the project information for the Atlanta store opening, as it’s very similar in size and scope to this store. You add those risks to your list as well. You divide some of the risks into the following categories: IT, Facilities, and Retail. A sample portion of your list appears as follows, with overall assign- ments made based on Qualitative Risk Analysis and the probability and impact matrix:\\n\\nCategory: IT\\n\\nT1 line availability and installation.

The contractor availability can be handled with a contingency plan that specifies a backup contractor should the first choice not be avail- able. For the POS terminals and hardware, you decide to use the transfer strategy. As part of the contract, you’ll require these vendors to deliver on time, and if they cannot, they’ll be required to provide and pay for rental equipment until they can get your gear delivered.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 203  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping a Risk Response Plan\\n\\n203\\n\\nThe Facilities risk and Retail risks will be handled with a combination of acceptance, contin- gency plans, and mitigation.\\n\\nYou’ve calculated the expected monetary value for several potential risk events. Two of them are detailed here.\\n\\nDesirable location has an expected monetary value of $780,000. The probability of choosing an incorrect or less-than-desirable location is 60 percent. The potential loss in sales is the differ- ence between $2.5 million in sales per year a high-producing store generates versus $1.2 mil- lion in sales per year an average store generates.\\n\\nThe expected monetary value of the product availability event is $50,000. The probability of the event occurring is 40 percent. The potential loss in sales is $125,000 for not opening the store in conjunction with the Garden and Home Show.\\n\\nProject Case Study Checklist\\n\\nRisk Management Planning\\n\\nRisk Identification\\n\\nDocumentation reviews\\n\\nInformation\\n\\n\\n\\ngathering techniques\\n\\nQualitative Risk Analysis\\n\\nRisk probability and impact\\n\\nProbability and impact rating\\n\\nList of prioritized risks\\n\\nQuantitative Risk Analysis\\n\\nInterviewing\\n\\nExpected monetary value\\n\\nRisk Response Planning\\n\\nAvoidance, transference, mitigation, and acceptance strategies\\n\\nRisk response plans documented\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n3601.book  Page 204  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n204\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCongratulations! You’ve completed another fun-filled, action-packed chapter and all of it on a single topic—risk. Risk is inherent in all projects and risks pose both threats and opportunities to the project. Understanding the risks facing the project better equips you to determine the appropriate strategies to deal with those risks and helps you determine the response plans for the risks (and the level of effort you should put into preparing those plans).\\n\\nThe Risk Management Planning process determines how you will plan for risks on your project. Its only output is the risk management plan, which details how you’ll define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan.\\n\\nThe Risk Identification process seeks to identify and document the project risks using brain- storming, the Delphi technique, interviewing, root cause identification, and SWOT. This list of risks gets recorded in the risk register, the only output of this process.\\n\\nQualitative Risk Analysis and Quantitative Risk Analysis involve evaluating risks and assigning probability and impact values to the risks. Many tools and techniques are used during these processes, including risk probability and impact, probability and impact matrix, inter- viewing, probability distributions, expert judgment, sensitivity analysis, decision tree analysis, and simulation.\\n\\nA probability and impact matrix uses the probability multiplied by the impact value to determine the risk score. The threshold of risk based on high, medium, and low tolerances is determined by comparing the risk score based on the probability level to the probability and impact matrix.\\n\\nMonte Carlo simulation is a technique used to quantify schedule or cost risks. Decision trees\\n\\ngraphically display decisions and their various choices and outcomes and is typically used in combination with earned monetary value.\\n\\nThe Risk Response Planning process is the last Planning process and culminates with an update to the risk register documenting the risk response plans. The risk response plans detail the strategies you’ll use to respond to risk and assign individuals to manage each risk response. Risk response strategies for negative risks include avoidance, mitigation, and transference. Risk strategies for positive risks include exploit, share, and enhance. Acceptance is a strategy for both negative and positive risks.\\n\\nContingency planning involves planning alternatives to deal with risk events should they\\n\\noccur. Contingency reserves are set aside to deal with risks associated with cost and time according to the stakeholder tolerance levels.\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to define the purpose of the risk management plan The risk management plan describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project. It details how risk management processes (including Risk Identification, Qualitative Risk Analysis, Quantita- tive Risk Analysis, Risk Response Planning, and Risk Monitoring and Control) will be imple- mented, monitored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. It describes how you will\\n\\n3601.book  Page 205  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\n205\\n\\nmanage risks but does not attempt to define responses to individual risks. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan and it’s the only output of the Risk Man- agement Planning process.\\n\\nBe able to name the purpose of Risk Identification. The purpose of the Risk Identification process is to identify all risks that may impact the project, document them, and identify their characteristics.\\n\\nBe able to define the purpose of Qualitative Risk Analysis. Qualitative Risk Analysis deter- mines the impact the identified risks will have on the project and the probability they’ll occur and puts the risks in priority order according to their effect on the project objectives.\\n\\nBe able to define the purpose of Quantitative Risk Analysis. Quantitative Risk Analysis evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized during the Qualitative Risk Analysis process and quan- tifies risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric probabilities to each risk and their impacts on project objectives.\\n\\nBe able to define the purpose of the Risk Response Planning process. Risk Response plan- ning is the process where risk response plans are developed using strategies such as avoid, trans- fer, mitigate, exploit, share, and enhance. The risk response plan describes the actions to take should the identified risks occur. It should include all the identified risks, a description of the risks, how they’ll impact the project objectives, and the people assigned to manage the risk responses.\\n\\nBe able to define the risk register and some of its primary elements. The risk register is an output of the Risk Identification process, and updates to the risk register occur as an output of every risk process that follows this one. By the end of the Risk Response Planning process, the risk register contains these primary elements: identified list of risks, risk owners, risk triggers, risk strategies, contingency plans, and contingency reserves.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 206  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n206\\n\\nChapter 5 (cid:2) Risk Planning\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

You work for a large manufacturing plant. You are working on a new project to release an over- seas product line. This is the company’s first experience in the overseas market, and it hopes to make a big splash with the introduction of this product. The stakeholders are a bit nervous about the project and historically proceed cautiously and take a considerable amount of time to exam- ine information before making a final decision. The project entails producing your product in a concentrated formula and packaging it in smaller containers than the U.S. product uses. A new machine is needed in order to mix the ingredients into a concentrated formula. After speaking with one of your stakeholders, you discover this will be the first machine your organization has purchased from your new supplier.

We’re at a place where we need to talk about some processes that aren’t necessarily related to each other but need to be completed before we can construct the project schedule and budget. So we’ll start out this chapter with two pro- curement processes—Plan Purchases and Acquisitions and Plan Contracting—and then move on to Human Resource Planning, where we will develop the staffing management plan. This plan will help guide us later on in acquiring our project team members.\\n\\nThen we’ll get back on track with a theme by finishing up the chapter with two processes that will start us off on the right foot toward estimating and scheduling activities. They are the Activ- ity Definition process and the Activity Sequencing process.\\n\\nAll of the processes we’ll talk about in this chapter are used to develop both the project sched- ule and budget, which are two of the most important documents in our project plan (we’ll dis- cuss those in the next chapter). Let’s get going.\\n\\nUnderstanding Purchases\\n\\nand Acquisitions\\n\\nPlan Purchases and Acquisitions is a process of identifying what goods or services you’re going to purchase from outside of the organization and which project needs can be met by the project team. Part of what you’ll accomplish in this process is determining whether you should purchase the goods or services and, if so, how much and when. Keep in mind that we’re discussing the pro- curement from the buyer’s perspective, as this is the approach used in\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK. The Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process can influence the project schedule and the project schedule can influence this process. For example, availability of a contractor or special order mate- rials may have a significant impact on the schedule. And conversely, your organization’s business cycle may have an impact on the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process if the organization is depen- dent on seasonal activity. The Activity Resource Estimating process, which we’ll cover in Chapter 7, also can be influenced by this process, as will make-or-buy decisions (we’ll get to those shortly).\\n\\nYou need to perform each process in the Project Procurement Management knowledge area (beginning with Plan Purchases and Acquisitions and ending with Contract Closure) for each product or service that you’re buying outside of the organization. Obviously, if you’re procuring all your resources from within the organization, the only process you’ll perform in this knowledge area is the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 217  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Purchases and Acquisitions\\n\\n217\\n\\nSometimes, your entire project will be procured from a vendor. In cases like these, the vendor will have a project manager assigned to the project. Your organization may choose to have an internal project manager assigned as well to act as the conduit between your company and the vendor and to provide information and monitor your organization’s deliverables. When this happens, the vendor or contracting company is responsible for fulfilling all of the project man- agement processes as part of the contract. In the case of an outsourced project, the seller—also known as the vendor, supplier, or contractor—manages the project and the buyer becomes the stakeholder. If you’re hiring a vendor, don’t forget to consider permits or professional licenses that may be required for the type of work you need them to perform.\\n\\nSeveral inputs are needed when planning for purchases. We’ll look at them next.\\n\\nPlan Purchases and Acquisitions Inputs\\n\\nThe Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process has six inputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nWork breakdown structure\\n\\nWBS dictionary\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nThe project management plan can include risk register, risk-related contractual agreements, resource requirements, project schedule, activity cost estimates, and cost baseline.\\n\\nMarketplace conditions are the key element of enterprise environmental factors you should\\n\\nconsider for this process. The organization’s guidelines, policies, and organizational policies (including any procurement policies) are the elements of the organizational process assets you should pay attention to here.\\n\\nMany organizations have procurement departments that are responsible for procuring goods and services and writing and managing contracts. Some organizations also require all contracts be reviewed by their legal department prior to signing. These are organizational process assets that you should con- sider when procuring goods and services is necessary.\\n\\nIt’s important for the project manager to understand organizational policies because they may impact many of the Planning processes, including the Procurement Planning processes. For example, the organization may have purchasing approval processes that must be followed. Per- haps orders for goods or services that exceed certain dollar amounts need different levels of approval. As the project manager, you need to be aware of policies like this so you’re certain you\\n\\n3601.book  Page 218  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n218\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2)\\n\\nResource Planning\\n\\ncan execute the project smoothly. It’s very frustrating to find out after the fact that you should have followed a certain process or policy and now, because you didn’t, you’ve got schedule delays or worse. You could consider using the “Sin now, ask forgiveness later” technique in extreme emergencies, but you didn’t hear that from me. By the way, that’s not a technique that’s authorized by\\n\\n. A Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nThe project manager and the project team will be responsible for coordinating all the orga-\\n\\nnizational interfaces for the project, including technical, human resource, purchasing, and finance. It will serve you well to understand the policies and politics involved in each of these areas in your organization.\\n\\nMy organization is steeped in policy. (A government organization steeped in pol- icy? Go figure!) It’s so steeped in policy we have to request the funds for large projects at least two years in advance. There are mounds and mounds of request forms, justification forms, approval forms, routing forms—you get the idea. But my point is if you miss one of the forms or don’t fill out the information correctly, you can set your project back by a minimum of a year, if not two. Then once the money is awarded, there are more forms to fill out and policies to follow. Again, if you don’t follow the policies correctly, you can jeopardize future project funds. Many organizations have a practice of not giving you all the project money up front in one lump sum. In other words, you must meet major milestones or com- plete a project phase before they’ll fund your next phase. Know what your orga- nizational policies are well ahead of time. Talk to the people that can walk you through the process and ask them to check your work to avoid surprises.\\n\\nThe project scope statement lists the deliverables and the acceptance criteria for the product or service of the project. Obviously, you’ll want to consider these when thinking about procur- ing goods and services. You’ll also want to consider the constraints (things like availability and timing of funds, availability of resources, delivery dates, vendor availability) and assumptions (things such as reliability of the vendor, assuming availability of key resources, adequate stake- holder involvement). The product scope description is included in the project scope statement as well and may alert you to special considerations (services, technical requirements, skills) needed to produce the product of the project.\\n\\nThe WBS and WBS dictionary identify the deliverables and describe the work required for each element of the WBS. The project management plan will provide you with guidance for procuring goods and services. For example, the risk-related contractual agreements component of this plan describes the types of services of goods needed for risk management. The transference strategy may require the purchase of insurance. Each of these elements should be reviewed when determining which goods and services will be performed within the project and which will be purchased.\\n\\nTools and Techniques for Plan Purchases and Acquisitions\\n\\nThere are three tools and techniques of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. They are make-or-buy analysis, expert judgment, and contract types. We’ve already covered expert judg- ment, so we’ll look at make-or-buy analysis next and then cover contract types after that.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 219  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Purchases and Acquisitions\\n\\n219\\n\\nMake\\n\\n\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n\\nBuy Analysis\\n\\nmake\\n\\n\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n\\nbuy analysis\\n\\nThe main decision you’re trying to get to in is whether it’s more cost effec- tive to buy the products and services or more cost effective for the organization to produce the goods and services needed for the project. Costs should include both direct costs—in other words, the actual cost to purchase the product or service—and indirect costs, such as the salary of the manager overseeing the purchase process or ongoing maintenance costs. Costs don’t nec- essarily mean the cost to purchase. In make-or-buy analysis, you might weigh the cost of leasing items versus buying them. For example, perhaps your project requires the use of a specialized piece of hardware that you know will be outdated by the end of the project. In a case like this, leasing may be a better option so that when the project is ready to be implemented, a newer ver- sion of the hardware can be tested and put into production during rollout.\\n\\nOther considerations in make-or-buy analysis might include things like capacity issues, skills, availability, and trade secrets. Strict control might be needed for a certain process, and thus the process cannot be outsourced. Perhaps your organization has the skills in-house to complete the project but your current project list is so backlogged that you can’t get to the new project for months, so you need to bring in a vendor.\\n\\nMake-or-buy analysis is considered a general management technique and concludes with the\\n\\ndecision to do one or the other.\\n\\nContract Types\\n\\ncontract\\n\\nA is a compulsory agreement between two or more parties and is used to acquire prod- ucts or services from outside the organization. Typically, money is exchanged for the goods or services. Contracts are enforceable by law and require an offer and an acceptance.\\n\\nThere are different types of contracts for different purposes.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\ndivides\\n\\ncontracts into three categories:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nFixed price or lump sum\\n\\nCost reimbursable\\n\\nTime and materials (T&M)\\n\\nWithin the fixed price and cost reimbursable categories there are different types of contracts. We’ll look at each in the following sections. Keep in mind that several things will impact the type of contract you should use. The product requirements (or service criteria) may drive the contract type. The market conditions may drive availability and price—remember back in the Year 2000 when there wasn’t a programmer to be found for under $200 an hour? And the amount of risk, for the seller, the buyer, and the project itself, will help determine contract type.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThere may be an exam question or two regarding contract types, so spend some time getting familiar with them.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 220  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n220\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2)\\n\\nResource Planning\\n\\nFixed Price or Lump Sum Contracts\\n\\nlump sum contracts\\n\\n(also referred to as\\n\\nFixed price contracts ) set a specific, firm price for the goods or services rendered. The buyer and seller agree on a well-defined deliverable for a set price. In this kind of contract, the biggest risk is borne by the seller. The seller—or contractor— must take great strides to assure they’ve covered their costs and will make a comfortable profit on the transaction. The seller assumes the risks of increasing costs, nonperformance, or other problems. However, to counter these unforeseen risks, the seller builds in the cost of the risk to the contract price.\\n\\nFixed price contracts can be disastrous for both the buyer and the seller if the scope of the project is not well defined or the scope changes dramatically. It’s important to have accurate, well-defined deliverables when you’re using this type of contract. Conversely, fixed price con- tracts are relatively safe for both buyer and seller when the original scope is well defined and remains unchanged. They typically reap only small profits for the seller and force the con- tractor to work productively and efficiently. This type of contract also minimizes cost and quality uncertainty.\\n\\nFixed price plus incentive contracts\\n\\nare another type of fixed price contract. The difference\\n\\nhere is that the contract includes an incentive—or bonus—for early completion or for some other agreed-upon performance criterion that’s exceeded according to contract specifications. The criteria for early completion, or other performance enhancements, must be spelled out in the contract so both parties understand the terms and conditions.\\n\\nAnother thing to note with fixed price plus incentive contracts is that some of the risk is borne by the buyer as opposed to the firm fixed price contract, where most all of the risk is borne by the seller. The buyer takes some risk, albeit minimal, by offering the incentive to, for example, get the work done earlier. Suppose the buyer really would like the product delivered 30 days prior to when the seller thinks they can deliver. In this case, the buyer assumes the risk for the early delivery via the incentive.\\n\\nCost Reimbursable Contracts\\n\\nare as the name implies. The allowable costs—allowable is defined Cost reimbursable contracts by the contract—associated with producing the goods or services are charged to the buyer. All the costs the seller takes on during the project are charged back to the buyer; thus the seller is reimbursed.\\n\\nCost reimbursable contracts carry the highest risk to the buyer because the total costs are uncertain. As problems arise, the buyer has to shell out even more money to correct the prob- lems. However, the advantage to the buyer with this type of contract is that scope changes are easy to make and can be made as often as you wish—but it will cost you.\\n\\nCost reimbursable contracts have a lot of uncertainty associated with them. There is little incentive for the contractor to work efficiently or be productive. This type of contract protects the contractor’s profit because increasing costs are passed back to the buyer rather than taken out of profits as would be the case with a fixed price contract. Be certain to audit your state- ments when using a contract like this so that charges from some other project the vendor is working on don’t accidentally end up on your bill.\\n\\nCost reimbursable contracts are used most often when there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the project scope, such as for cutting-edge projects and research and development. They are also\\n\\n3601.book  Page 221  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding Purchases and Acquisitions\\n\\n221\\n\\nused for projects that have large investments early in the project life. Let’s discuss the three kinds of cost reimbursable contracts:\\n\\ncost plus percentage of cost (CPPC)\\n\\nCost plus fee (CPF) or cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) , the seller is reimbursed for allowable costs tract, also called plus a fee that’s calculated as a percentage of the costs. The percentage is agreed upon before- hand and documented in the contract. Since the fee is based on costs, the fee is variable. The lower the costs, the lower the fee, so the seller doesn’t have a lot of motivation to keep costs low.\\n\\ncost plus fee (CPF)\\n\\nIn the\\n\\ncon\\n\\n\\n\\nCost plus fixed fee (CPFF)\\n\\nCost plus fixed fee (CPFF) project costs to the seller and include a fixed fee upon completion of the contract. This is how the seller makes money on the deal; the fixed fee portion is the seller’s profit. The fee is always firm in this kind of contract, but the costs are variable. The seller doesn’t necessarily have a lot of motivation to control costs with this type of contract, as you can imagine. And the only moti- vation to complete the project is driven by the fixed fee portion of the contract.\\n\\ncontracts charge back all allowable\\n\\nThe next category of cost reimbursable contract is Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) This is the type of contract in which the buyer reimburses the seller for the incentive fee (CPIF). seller’s allowable costs and includes an incentive for exceeding the performance criteria laid out in the contract. An incentive fee actually encourages better cost performance by the seller, and there is a possibility of shared savings between the seller and buyer if performance criteria are exceeded. The qualification for exceeded performance must be written into the contract and agreed to by both parties, as should the definition of allowable costs; the seller can possibly lose the incentive fee if agreed-upon targets are not reached.\\n\\ncost plus\\n\\nThere is moderate risk for the buyer under the cost plus incentive fee contract, and if well-writ- ten, it can be more beneficial for both the seller and buyer than a cost reimbursable contract.\\n\\nTime and Materials (T&M) Contracts\\n\\nTime and materials (T&M) contracts contracts. The full amount of the material costs is not known at the time the contract is awarded. This resembles a cost reimbursable contract because the costs will continue to grow during the contract’s life and are reimbursable to the contractor.\\n\\nare a cross between the fixed price and cost reimbursable\\n\\nT&M contracts can resemble fixed price contracts when unit rates are used, for example. Unit rates may be used to preset the rates of certain elements or portions of the project. For example, a contracting agency might charge you $135 per hour for a Java programmer, or a leasing com- pany may charge you $2,000 per month for the hardware you’re renting during the testing phase of your project. These rates are preset and agreed upon by the buyer and seller ahead of time.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand the difference between a fixed price contract and a cost reimbursable contract for the exam. Also know when each type of contract should be used and which party bears the most risk under each type of contract.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 222  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n222\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2)\\n\\nResource Planning\\n\\nPlan Purchases and Acquisitions Outputs\\n\\nThere are four outputs of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process.

If the buyer does not know how to prepare a contract SOW or the seller would be better at creating the SOW due to their expertise about the product or service, the seller may\\n\\n3601.book  Page 223  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nPlan Contracting\\n\\n223\\n\\nprepare it and then give it to the buyer to review. In either case, the contract statement of work is developed from the project scope statement and the WBS and WBS dictionary.\\n\\nThe seller uses the contract SOW to determine whether they are able to produce the goods or services as specified. In addition, it wouldn’t hurt to include a copy of the WBS with the con- tract SOW. Any information the seller can use to properly price the goods or services helps both sides understand what’s needed and how it will be provided.\\n\\nProjects may require some or all of the work of the project to be provided by a vendor. The\\n\\nPlan Purchases and Acquisitions process determines if goods or services should be produced within the organization or procured from outside, and if goods or services are procured from outside, it describes what will be outsourced and what kind of contract to use and then docu- ments the information in the contract SOW and procurement management plan.\\n\\nYou prepared a SOW during the Develop Project Charter process. You can use that SOW as the contract SOW during this process if you’re contracting out the entire project. Otherwise, you can use just those portions of the SOW that describe the work you’re contracting for.\\n\\nMake\\n\\n\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n\\nBuy Decisions\\n\\nThe make-or-buy decision is a document that outlines the decisions made during the process regarding which goods and or services will be produced by the organization and which will be purchased. This can include any number of items, including services, products, insurance poli- cies, performance, and performance bonds.\\n\\nRequested Changes\\n\\nLike many of the other processes we’ve discussed so far, requested changes may come about as a result of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. Those changes, like all the others, should be processed through the Integrated Change Control process.\\n\\nOnce we’ve determine which goods and services we’re going to procure and decided on the best type of contract to use for our situation, we’ll move into the Plan Contracting processes to prepare the information needed for choosing a vendor.\\n\\nPlan Contracting\\n\\nPlan Contracting\\n\\nThe purpose of is to prepare the documents you’ll use in the Request Seller Responses and Select Sellers processes. We’ll discuss these processes in Chapter 9, “Measuring and Controlling Project Performance.” The inputs to this process are the procurement manage- ment plan, contract statement of work, make-or-buy decisions, and the project management plan (with special attention to the risk register, risk-related contractual agreements, resource requirements, project schedule, activity cost estimates, and cost baseline). We’ve covered all these inputs previously.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 224  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n224\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2)\\n\\nResource Planning\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of Plan Contracting are standard forms and expert judgment. Stan- dard forms are used to facilitate the procurement process. These are forms that are standardized for your organization and for the types of goods or services typically procured by the organi- zation. Your organization may or may not have standard forms. They are usually found in orga- nizations that write a lot of contracts and procure a significant number of goods and services. They may include standard contract forms, nondisclosure agreements, proposal evaluation cri- teria, and so on.\\n\\nPlan Contracting Outputs\\n\\nThe three outputs of the Plan Contracting process are procurement documents, evaluation cri- teria, and contract statement of work updates. Let’s take a quick look at each.\\n\\nProcurement Documents\\n\\nProcurement documents are used to solicit vendors and suppliers to bid on your procurement needs. You’re probably familiar with some of the titles of procurement documents. They might be called request for proposal (RFP), request for information (RFI), invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), and so on.\\n\\nProcurement documents should clearly state the description of the work requested, they should\\n\\ninclude the contract SOW, and they should explain how sellers should format and submit their responses. These documents are prepared by the buyer to assure as accurate and complete a response as possible from all potential bidders. Any special provisions or contractual needs should be spelled out as well. For example, many organizations have data concerning their marketing policies, new products introductions planned for the next few years, trade secrets, and so on. The vendor will have access to this private information, and in order to ensure they maintain confidentiality, you should require that they sign a nondisclosure agreement.\\n\\nA few terms are used during this process—usually interchangeably—that you should be\\n\\nquo- are used, as in IFB or RFQ. When considerations other than price (such as technology or is used, as in RFP. A\\n\\naware of. When your decision is going to be made primarily on price, the terms tation specific approaches to the project) are the deciding factor, the term These terms are used interchangeably in practice, even though they have specific meanings in Guide to the PMBOK.\\n\\nproposal\\n\\nand\\n\\nbid\\n\\nIn my organization, all solicitation requests are submitted as RFPs, even though our primary deciding factor is price.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand the differences in procurement document terms for the exam.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 225  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nPlan Contracting\\n\\n225\\n\\nProcurement documents are posted or advertised according to your organizational policies.\\n\\nThis may include ads in newspapers and magazines or Internet posting.\\n\\nEvaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluation criteria refers to the method your organization will use to choose a vendor from among the proposals you receive. The criteria may be subjective or objective. In some cases, price may be the only criteria, and that means the vendor that submits the lowest bid will win the contract. You should only use purchase price (which should include costs associated with purchase price, like delivery and setup charges) as the sole criteria when there are multiple qual- ified sellers to choose from.\\n\\nOther projects may require more extensive criteria than price alone. In this case, scoring models might be used as well as rating models, or purely subjective methods of selection might be utilized. An example weighted scoring method was described in Chapter 2, “Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement,” in the section “Benefit Measurement Meth- ods.” This method can easily be used to score vendor proposals.\\n\\nSometimes, the evaluation criteria are made public in the procurement process so that ven- dors know exactly what you’re looking for. There are pros and cons to this approach. If the organization typically makes known the evaluation criteria, you’ll find that almost all the ven- dors that bid on the project meet every criteria you’ve outlined (in writing that is). When it comes time to perform the contract, however, you may encounter some surprises. The vendor might have done a great job of writing up the bid based on your criteria, but in reality they don’t know how to put the criteria into practice. On the other hand, having all the criteria publicly known beforehand gives ground to great discussion points and discovery later on in the pro- curement processes.\\n\\nThe following list includes some of the criteria you can consider using for evaluating pro-\\n\\nposals and bids:\\n\\nComprehension and understanding of the needs of the project as documented in the contract SOW Technical ability of vendor and their proposed team Experience on projects of similar size and scope, including references Project management approach Management approach Financial stability and capacity Intellectual and proprietary rights You could include these in a weighted scoring model and rate each vendor on how well they\\n\\nresponded to these issues.\\n\\nContract SOW Updates\\n\\nYou may find that changes to the contract statement of work are needed as a result of develop- ing the procurement documents. These updates are usually made at the end of the Plan Con- tracting process.\\n\\nLet’s switch gears now and take a look at how we plan for the types of resources we’ll need\\n\\non the project in the Human Resource Planning process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 226  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n226\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nThe Customer Relationship Management System Response\\n\\nRyan Hunter is preparing the evaluation criteria for an RFP for a customer relationship man- agement (CRM) software system. After meeting with key stakeholders and other project man- agers in the company who’ve had experience working on projects of this size and scope, he devised the first draft of the evaluation criteria. A partial list is shown here.\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSuccessful bidder’s response must detail how business processes (as documented in the RFP page 24) will be addressed with their solution.\\n\\nSuccessful bidder must document their project management approach, which must follow PMI’s A Guide to the PMBOK project practices. Must provide an example project manage- ment plan based on a previous project experience of similar size and scope to the one doc- umented in the RFP.\\n\\nSuccessful bidder must document previous successful implementations, including inte- gration with existing organization’s PBX and network operating system, and must provide references.\\n\\nSuccessful bidder must provide financial statements for the previous three years.\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning\\n\\nAll projects require human resources, from the smallest project to the largest. The Human Resource Planning process documents the roles and responsibilities of individuals or groups for various project elements and then documents the reporting relationships for each. Reporting relationships can be assigned to groups as well as to individuals, and the groups or individuals may be internal or external to the organization or a combination of both. Communications Planning goes hand in hand with Human Resource Planning, because the organizational struc- ture affects the way communications are carried out among project participants and the project interfaces.\\n\\nThe three outputs of this process include documenting roles and responsibilities, creating and\\n\\ndocumenting the staffing management plan, and creating the organization chart.\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning Inputs\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning has three inputs: enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets, and project management plan (particularly the activity resource requirements). We’ll take a look at the key elements of each of these next.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 227  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning\\n\\n227\\n\\nKey Environmental Factors for Human Resource Planning\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors play a key role in determining human resource roles and responsibilities. The type of organization you work in, the reporting relationships, and the tech- nical skills needed to complete the project work are a few of the factors you should consider when developing the staffing management plan. Let’s briefly look at the factors A Guide to the PMBOK details:\\n\\nOrganizational factors Consider what departments or organization units will have a role on the project, the interactions between and among departments, and the level of formality in these working relationships.\\n\\nTechnical factors Consider the types of specialized skills needed to complete the work of the project (for example, programming languages, engineering skills, knowledge of pharmaceuti- cals) and any technical considerations during hand-off from phase to phase or from project completion to production.\\n\\nInterpersonal factors Interpersonal factors have to do with potential project team members. You should consider their experience, skills, current reporting relationships, cultural consider- ations, and perceptions regarding their levels of trust and respect for coworkers and superiors.\\n\\nLocation and logistics Consider where the project team is physically located and whether they are all located together or at separate facilities (or cities or countries).\\n\\nPolitical factors Political factors involve your stakeholders. Consider the amount of influence the stakeholders have, their interactions and influence with each other, and the power they can exert over the project.\\n\\nIn addition to these factors, you should also consider project constraints. The topic of con- straints seems to come up a lot, so you probably remember that constraints are things that limit the options available to the project team. These typically involve time, costs, scope, and quality. However, there are a few new constraints regarding project teams that you should know about:\\n\\nOrganizational structures Organizational structures can be constraints. For example, a strong matrix organization provides the project manager with much more authority and power than the weak matrix organization does. Functional organizations typically do not empower their project managers with the proper authority to carry out a project. If you work in a functional organization as I do, it’s important to be aware that you’ll likely face power struggles with other managers and, in some cases, a flat-out lack of cooperation. Don’t tell them I said this, but func- tional managers tend to be territorial and aren’t likely to give up control easily. The best advice I have for you in this case is as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEstablish open communications early on in the project.\\n\\nInclude all the functional managers with key roles in important decisions.\\n\\nGet the support of your project sponsor to empower you (as the project manager) with as much authority as possible. It’s important that the sponsor makes it clear to the other managers that their cooperation on project activities is expected.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 228  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n228\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nCollective bargaining agreements Collective bargaining agreements are actually contractual obligations of the organization. Collective bargaining is typically associated with unions and organized employee associations. Other organized employee associations or groups may require specialized reporting relationships as well—especially if they involve contractual obligations. You will not likely be involved in the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements, but if you have an opportunity to voice opinions regarding employee duties or agreements that would be helpful to your project or future projects, by all means take it.\\n\\nEconomic conditions These conditions refer to the availability of funds for the project team to perform training, hire staff, and travel. If funds are severely limited and your project requires frequent trips to other locations, you have an economic constraint on your hands.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand the key environmental factors and the three constraints that can impact the Human Resource Planning process for the exam.\\n\\nOrganizational Process Assets in Human Resource Planning\\n\\nThere are two primary elements of the organizational process assets input you should consider during this process. They are templates and checklists.\\n\\nTemplates, in this case, refers to documentation like project descriptions, organizational charts, performance appraisals, the organization’s conflict management process, and so on.\\n\\nChecklists may include elements like training requirements, project roles and responsibilities,\\n\\nskills and competency levels, safety issues, and so on.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, using templates and checklists is one way to ensure that you don’t miss any key responsibilities when planning the project and will help reduce the amount of time spent on project planning.\\n\\nProject Management Plan\\n\\nWe’ve examined the project management plan as an input to other Planning processes. In the Human Resource Planning process, you’ll want to pay particular attention to the activity resource requirements because they outline the types and quantities of resources needed for project activ- ities. (Activity resource requirements are an output of the Activity Resource Estimating process, which we’ll talk about in Chapter 7, “Creating the Project Schedule and Budget.”)\\n\\n3601.book  Page 229  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning\\n\\n229\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThere are three tools and techniques in the Human Resource Planning process. Remember that our goal is to produce the organizational chart, roles and responsibilities, and staffing manage- ment plan outputs at the end of this process. You’ll see that the tools and techniques directly contribute to these outputs. They are organization charts and position descriptions, network- ing, and organizational theory. We’ll look at each of these in the following sections.\\n\\nOrganization Charts and Position Descriptions\\n\\nWe’ve all seen an organization chart. It usually documents your name, your position, your boss, your boss’s boss, your boss’s boss’s boss, and so on. The important thing to note in this tool and technique is that there are three ways this information may be presented: hierarchical (which describes most organization charts), matrix, and text.\\n\\nHierarchical Charts\\n\\nHierarchical charts, like a WBS, are designed in a top-down format. The head boss is at the top, the directors that report to the head boss are shown next, and so on descending down the struc- ture. An organization breakdown structure (OBS) is a form of organization chart that shows how the WBS elements relate to the organization’s departments, work units, or teams rather than individuals.\\n\\nA resource breakdown structure (RBS) is another type of hierarchical chart that breaks down\\n\\nthe work of the project according to the types of resources needed. (RBS also stands for risk breakdown structure as we learned in the last chapter.) For example, you may have program- mers, database analysts, and network analysts as resource types on the RBS. However, they won’t all necessarily work on the project team. You may have programmers reporting to the project team, the finance department, and the customer service department, for example. An RBS can help track project costs because it ties to the organization’s accounting system. Let’s suppose you have programming resources in the RBS at the junior, advanced, and senior levels. Each of these levels of programmer has an average hourly salary recorded in the accounting sys- tem that makes it easy for you to track project costs. Ten senior programmers, 14 advanced, and 25 junior-level programmers are easy to calculate and track.\\n\\nMatrix\\n\\n\\n\\nBased Charts\\n\\nMatrix-based charts are used to show the type of resource and the responsibility they have on the project. Many times a project manager will use a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) to graphically display this information. A RAM is usually depicted as a chart with resource names listed in each row (for example, programmers, testers and trainers) and project phases or WBS elements listed as the columns. (It can also be constructed using team member names.) Indicators in the intersections show where the resources are needed. However, the level of detail is up to you. One RAM might be developed showing only project phases. Another RAM may show level 2 WBS elements for a complex project, with more RAMs subsequently produced for the additional WBS levels. Or a RAM might be constructed with level 3 elements only.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 230  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n230\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, the RAM relates the OBS to the WBS to assure that every component of the work of the project is assigned to an individual.\\n\\nTable 6.1 shows a sample portion of a type of RAM called a RACI chart for a software devel- opment team. In this example, the RACI chart shows the level of accountability each of the partic- ipants has on the project. The letters in the acronym RACI are the designations shown in the chart:\\n\\nR = Responsible for performing the work A = Accountable, the one who approves or signs off on the work C = Consult, someone who has input to the work or decisions I = Inform, someone who must be informed of the decisions or results\\n\\nT A B L E 6 . 1\\n\\nSample RAM\\n\\nKaren\\n\\nRae\\n\\nMelinee\\n\\nJoJo\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nTest\\n\\nImplement\\n\\nR\\n\\nI\\n\\nC\\n\\nA\\n\\nR\\n\\nI\\n\\nC\\n\\nC\\n\\nR\\n\\nC\\n\\nA\\n\\nA\\n\\nLegend: R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consult, I = Inform\\n\\nIn this example, Karen is responsible for design, meaning she does the work, but Rae is\\n\\naccountable and the one who must approve design. This a great tool because it shows at a glance not only where a resource is working but what that resource’s responsibility level is on the project.\\n\\nText\\n\\n\\n\\nOriented Formats\\n\\nText-oriented formats are used when you have a significant amount of detail to record. These are also called position descriptions or role-responsibility-authority forms. These forms detail (as the name implies) the role, responsibility, and authority of the resource and they make great templates to use for future projects.\\n\\nDon’t forget that other subsidiary plans of the project management plan may also describe roles and responsibilities. For example, you’ll recall from Chapter 5 that the risk register lists the risk owners and their responsibility, so be certain to check these documents when outlining roles and responsibilities as well.\\n\\nNetworking\\n\\nNetworking in this process doesn’t refer to the technical kind of networking with servers, switches, and fiber. It means human resource networking; that is, you know someone who\\n\\n3601.book  Page 231  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning\\n\\n231\\n\\nknows someone who knows someone. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, there are several types of networking activities: proactive communication, lunch meetings (my personal favor- ite), informal conversations (ah…the information you learn by hanging out at the water cooler), and trade conferences (another favorite because they get you out of the office).\\n\\nOrganizational Theory\\n\\nOrganizational theory refers to all the theories that attempt to explain what makes people, teams, and work units perform the way they do. We’ll talk more about motivation techniques (which are a type of organizational theory) in Chapter 8, “Developing the Project Team.” Orga- nizational theory improves the probability that planning will be effective and helps shorten the amount of time it takes to produce the Human Resource Planning outputs.\\n\\nHuman Resource Planning Outputs\\n\\nThe Human Resource Planning process has three outputs: roles and responsibilities, project organizational charts, and the staffing management plan. We’ve already covered organization charts in detail, so we’ll take a look at the other two outputs now.\\n\\nRoles and Responsibilities\\n\\nThis output is the list of roles and responsibilities for the project team. It can take the form of the RAM or RACI chart we talked about earlier or the roles and responsibilities can be recorded in text format. The key elements you should include in the roles and responsibilities documen- tation are the following:\\n\\nRoles Describes what part of the project the individuals or teams are accountable for. This should also include a description of authority levels, responsibilities, and what work is not included as part of the role.\\n\\nAuthority Describes the amount of authority the resource has to make decisions, dictate direc- tion, and approve the work.\\n\\nResponsibility Describes the work required to complete the project activities.\\n\\nCompetency Describes the skills and ability needed to perform the project activities.\\n\\nStaffing Management Plan\\n\\nThe staffing management plan documents how and when human resources are introduced to the project and the criteria for releasing them. As with the other management plans we’ve dis- cussed, the level and amount of detail contained in this plan are up to you. It can be formal or informal, and it can contain lots of detail or only high-level detail.\\n\\nThe staffing management plan is a subsidiary plan to the project management plan and should be updated throughout the project. There are several elements that should be considered for inclusion in the staffing management plan, including the following:\\n\\nStaff acquisition This describes how team members are acquired (from inside or outside the organization), where they’re located, and the costs for specific skills and expertise. We’ll talk more about staff acquisition in Chapter 8.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 232  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n232\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nTimetable This describes the time frames in which the resources will be needed on the project and when the recruitment process should begin. The resources can be described individually, by teams, or by function (programmers, testers, etc.). Many staffing management plans make use of a resource histogram. This is usually drawn in chart form, with project time along the hori- zontal axis and hours needed along the vertical axis. The following example histogram shows the hours needed for an asphalt crew on a construction project:\\n\\nResource Histogram for Asphalt Crew\\n\\ns\\n\\nr\\n\\nu\\n\\no\\n\\nH\\n\\nf\\n\\nf\\n\\na\\n\\nt\\n\\nS\\n\\n235\\n\\n215\\n\\n195\\n\\n175\\n\\n155\\n\\nJan\\n\\nFeb\\n\\nMar\\n\\nApril\\n\\nRelease criteria Attention should be given to how you’ll release project team members at the end of their assignment. You should have reassignment procedures in place to move folks on to other projects or back to assignments they had before the project. This reduces overall project costs because you pay them only for the time they work and then release them. You won’t have a ten- dency to simply keep them busy between assignments or until the end of their scheduled end date if they complete their activities early. Having these procedures in place will also improve morale because everyone will be clear about how reassignment will occur. This should reduce anxiety about their opportunity for employment at the conclusion of the project or their assignment.\\n\\nTraining needs This describes any training plans needed for team members who don’t have the required skills or abilities to perform project tasks.\\n\\nRecognition and rewards This describe the systems you’ll use to reward and reinforce desired behavior. We’ll talk more about recognition and rewards in Chapter 8.\\n\\nIf your project involves regulations that must be met or contractual obligations\\n\\nCompliance (such as union contracts), the staffing management plan should detail these and any human resource policies the organization has in place that deal with compliance issues.\\n\\nSafety Any safety policies and procedures that are applicable to the project or industry you work in should be included in the staffing management plan.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nMake certain you understand the roles and responsibilities and the staffing management out- put and what each of these entails for the exam.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 233  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDefining Activity Definition\\n\\n233\\n\\nDefining Activity Definition\\n\\nNow we’re off and running toward the development of our project schedule. In order to develop the schedule, we first need to define the activities, sequence them in the right order, estimate resources, and estimate the time it will take to complete the tasks. We’ll cover the Activity Definition here, cover Activity Sequencing processes next, and pick up with the estimating processes in the next chapter.\\n\\nActivity Definition, Activity Sequencing, Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration Estimating, and Schedule Development are separate processes, each with inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. In practice, especially for small- to medium-sized projects, these processes can be combined into one process or step. We’ll take a look at the first two activity-related processes now. Chapter 7 describes the Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration Estimating, and Schedule Development processes.\\n\\nThe Activity Definition process is a further breakdown of the work package elements of the WBS. It documents the specific activities needed to fulfill the deliverables detailed on the WBS. This process may be performed by the project manager, or when the WBS is broken down to the subproject level, this process (and all the “Activity” processes that follow) might be assigned to a subproject manager.\\n\\nActivity Definition Process Inputs\\n\\nThe inputs to the Activity Definition process and the key elements you should consider as inputs to this process are shown in the following list:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors (project management information systems and scheduling software tools)\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets (existing guidelines and policies)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement (deliverables, constraints, and assumptions)\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS (this is the primary input to this process)\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS dictionary\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan (schedule management plan)\\n\\nTools and Techniques for Defining Activities\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of the Activity Definition process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDecomposition\\n\\nTemplates\\n\\nRolling wave planning\\n\\nExpert judgment\\n\\nPlanning component\\n\\n3601.book  Page 234  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n234\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nDecomposition is the process of breaking the work packages into smaller, more manageable units of work called schedule activities. These are not deliverables but the individual units of work that must be completed to fulfill the deliverables. Activity lists (which are one of the out- puts of this process) from prior projects can be used as templates in this process. Rolling wave planning involves planning near-term work in more detail than future-term work. Expert judg- ment, in the form of project team members with prior experience developing project scope state- ments and WBSs, can help you define activities.\\n\\nThe planning component is a new tool and technique we haven’t seen before. Two of the plan- ning components discussed in A Guide to the PMBOK are the control account and the planning package. The idea with this tool and technique is that you may have WBS elements that really can’t be broken down much further. In that case, the work package level in those branches of the WBS can be used to develop high-level schedules and plan future work at higher levels of the WBS. You can use a control account within the WBS to assign a management control point any- where above the work package level to use as a basis for planning when the work package level hasn’t been planned. The planning package is any element on the WBS that’s below the control account but still above the work package level used for planning purposes.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe purpose of the Activity Definition process is to decompose the work packages into sched- ule activities where the basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, and monitoring and con- trolling the work of the project are easily supported and accomplished.\\n\\nActivity Definition Outputs\\n\\nActivity Definition has four outputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nActivity list\\n\\nActivity attributes\\n\\n(cid:2) Milestone list\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nYou’ll be happy to know that we aren’t going to create an Activity Definition management plan at the end of this process. We’ve looked at requested changes before. We’ll examine the rest of the outputs here.\\n\\nActivity List\\n\\nOne primary output of the Activity Definition process is called an activity list. The activity list should contain all the schedule activities that will be performed for the project, with a scope of work description of each activity and an identifier (such as a code or number) so that team members understand what the work is and how it is to be completed. The schedule activities are individual ele- ments of the project schedule, and the activity list is a subsidiary of the project management plan.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 235  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding the Activity Sequencing Process\\n\\n235\\n\\nIn practice, when you’re working on a small project or projects that aren’t that complex, Activity Definition might be accomplished during the construction of the WBS and the activities themselves become the work package level. How- ever, for the exam, remember that activities are elements of the project sched- ule but they are not a part of the WBS.\\n\\nActivity Attributes\\n\\nActivity attributes describe the characteristics of the activities and are an extension of the activ- ity list. Activity attributes may describe information such as the activity identifier or code, descriptions, constraints and assumptions associated with the activity, activities that come before this activity (predecessor activities) and after this activity (successor activities), resource requirements, the individual responsible for completing the work, and so on. The activity attributes are used in the schedule model tool and technique of the Schedule Development pro- cess (we’ll talk about this in the next chapter).\\n\\nMilestone Lists\\n\\nMilestones are typically major accomplishments of the project and mark the completion of major deliverables or some other key event in the project. For example, approval and sign- off on project deliverables might be considered milestones. Other examples might be com- pletion of a prototype, system testing, contract approval, and so on. The milestone list records these accomplishments and documents whether the milestone is mandatory or optional. The milestone list is part of the project management plan and is also used to help develop the project schedule.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Activity Sequencing\\n\\nProcess\\n\\nNow that you’ve identified the schedule activities, you need to sequence them in a logical order and find out if dependencies exist among the activities. The interactivity of logical relationships must be sequenced correctly in order to facilitate the development of a realistic, achievable project schedule in a later process.\\n\\nConsider a classic example. Let’s say you’re going to paint your house but, unfortunately, it’s fallen into a little disrepair. The old paint is peeling and chipping and will need to be scraped before a coat of primer can be sprayed on the house. After the primer dries, the painting can commence. In this example, the primer activity depends on the scraping. You can’t—okay, you shouldn’t—prime the house before scraping off the peeling paint. The painting activity depends on the primer activity in the same way. You really shouldn’t start painting until the primer has dried.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 236  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n236\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nDuring Activity Sequencing, you will use a host of inputs and tools and techniques to pro-\\n\\nduce the primary output, project schedule network diagrams. We’ve already seen all of the inputs. They are project scope statement, activity list, activity attributes, milestone list, and approved change requests. These were discussed in this and other chapters. There are several new tools and techniques that we’ll look at now.\\n\\nActivity Sequencing Tools and Techniques\\n\\nActivity Sequencing has five tools and techniques, all of which are new to us:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPrecedence diagramming method (PDM)\\n\\nArrow diagramming method (ADM)\\n\\nSchedule network templates\\n\\nDependency determination\\n\\nApplying leads and lags\\n\\nI’m going to switch the order of these and look at dependency determination first. In practice,\\n\\nyou’ll define dependencies either before or while you’re using the PDM or ADM methods to draw your network templates, so to make sure we’re all on the same page with A Guide to the PMBOK terminology regarding dependencies, we’ll cover them first and then move on to the other tools and techniques.\\n\\nDependency Determination\\n\\nDependencies are relationships between the activities in which one activity is dependent on another to complete an action or perhaps an activity is dependent on another to start an action before it can proceed. Dependency determination is a matter of determining where those depen- dencies exist. Thinking back to the house-painting example, we couldn’t paint until the scraping and priming activities were completed. There are three types of dependencies you’ll want to know about for the exam:\\n\\n(cid:2) Mandatory dependencies\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDiscretionary dependencies\\n\\nExternal dependencies\\n\\nAs you’ve probably guessed, A Guide to the PMBOK defines dependencies differently\\n\\ndepending on their characteristics.\\n\\nLet’s look at each of these in more detail.\\n\\nMandatory dependencies Mandatory dependencies, also known as hard logic or hard depen- dencies, are defined by the type of work being performed. The scraping, primer, painting sequences are examples of mandatory dependencies. The nature of the work itself dictates the order in which the activities should be performed. Activities with physical limitations are a tell- tale sign that you have a mandatory dependency on your hands.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 237  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding the Activity Sequencing Process\\n\\n237\\n\\nDiscretionary dependencies Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project manage- ment team. Discretionary dependencies are also known as preferred logic, soft logic, or prefer- ential logic. These are usually process or procedure driven or “best practices” techniques based on past experience. For example, both past experience and best practices on house-painting projects has shown that all trim work should be hand-painted while the bulk of the main paint- ing work should be done with a sprayer.\\n\\nExternal dependencies External dependencies are, well, external to the project. This may seem obvious, but A Guide to the PMBOK points out that even though the dependency is external to the project (and therefore a non-project activity), it impacts project activities. For example, perhaps your project is researching and marketing a new drug. The FDA must approve the drug before your company can market it. This is not a project activity, but the project cannot move forward until approval occurs. That means FDA approval is an external dependency.\\n\\nOnce you’ve identified the dependencies and assembled all the other inputs for the Activity\\n\\nSequencing process, you’ll take this information and produce a diagram—or schematic dis- play—of the project activities. The project schedule network diagram shows the dependencies— or logical relationships—that exist among the activities. You can use one of the other tools and techniques of this process to produce this output. Let’s examine each in detail.\\n\\nPrecedence Diagramming Method (PDM)\\n\\nThe precedence diagramming method (PDM) is what most project management software pro- grams use to do activity sequencing today. Precedence diagrams use boxes or rectangles to rep- resent the activities (called nodes). The nodes are connected with arrows showing the dependencies between the activities. This method is also called activity on node (AON).\\n\\nThe minimum information that should be displayed on the node is the activity name, but you may put as much information about the activity on the node as you’d like. Sometimes the nodes are displayed with activity name, activity number, start and stop dates, due dates, slack time, and so on. (We’ll cover slack time in Chapter 7. For the exam, remember that the PDM uses only one time estimate to determine duration.)\\n\\nThe following graphic shows a PDM—or AON—of the house-painting example.\\n\\nProject\\n\\nStart\\n\\nScrape\\n\\nPrime\\n\\nPaint\\n\\nFinish\\n\\nClean Equipment\\n\\nThe PDM is further defined by four types of logical relationships (also known as dependen-\\n\\ncies; precedence relationships is another term used to describe these relationships).You may already be familiar with these if you’ve used Microsoft Project or similar project management software program. The four dependencies, or logical relationships, are as follows:\\n\\nFinish-to-start (FS) The finish-to-start relationship is the most frequently used relationship. This relationship says that the independent—or from activity—must finish before the dependent—or to activity—can start. In PDM diagrams, this is the most often used logical relationship.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 238  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n238\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nStart-to-finish (SF) The start-to-finish relationship says that the independent activity must start before the dependent activity can finish. This logical relationship is seldom used.\\n\\nFinish-to-finish (FF) The finish-to-finish relationship says that the independent activity must finish before the dependent activity finishes.\\n\\nStart-to-start (SS) that the independent activity must start before the dependent activity can start.\\n\\nI think you’re getting the hang of this. The start-to-start relationship says\\n\\nKeep these logical relationships (or dependencies) in mind when constructing your project schedule network diagram. Remember that finish-to-start is the most commonly used depen- dency in the PDM method. This is also the dependency type you should employ when you’re using project management software to diagram your activities. Using the other dependencies in most project management software programs will likely produce unpredictable results.\\n\\nArrow Diagramming Method (ADM)\\n\\nThe arrow diagramming method (ADM) is visually the opposite of the PDM. The arrow diagram- ming method places activities on the arrows, which are connected to dependent activities with nodes. This method is also called activity on arrow (AOA). This technique isn’t used nearly as often as PDM, but there are some industries that prefer the ADM to the PDM. For the record, note that ADM allows for more than one time estimate to determine duration and uses only the finish- to-start dependency. And there’s one more unique note about ADM to tuck away: Sometimes dummy activities must be plugged into the diagram to accurately display the dependencies.\\n\\nThe following example shows the ADM method applied to the house-painting example:\\n\\nStart\\n\\nScrape\\n\\nPrime\\n\\nPaint\\n\\nFinish\\n\\nClean Equipment\\n\\nRemove Masking\\n\\nSchedule Network Templates\\n\\nSchedule network templates are like the templates we’ve talked about in other processes. Per- haps the project you’re working on is similar to a project that’s been completed in the past. You can use a previous project schedule network diagram as a template for the current project. Or you may be working on a project with several deliverables that are fairly identical. You can use the first network diagram as a template and then modify it for each of the other deliverables.\\n\\nApplying Leads and Lags\\n\\nLeads and lags should be considered when determining dependencies. Lags delay successor activities (those that follow a predecessor activity) and require time added either to the start date or to the finish date of the activity you’re scheduling. Leads, conversely, speed up the successor activities and require time to be subtracted from the start date or the finish date of the activity you’re scheduling.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 239  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUnderstanding the Activity Sequencing Process\\n\\n239\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nI recommend you memorize the following graphic to help you remember the tools and tech- niques of the Activity Sequencing process and their characteristics for the exam. This may look a little strange, but I think it will work for you now that you understand what each of these dia- gramming methods is about. This is information you need to know for the exam. If this graphic isn’t useful for you, come up with your own mnemonic or sample that will help you remember which of these is which. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.\\n\\nPDM = AON = 1 Time Estimate\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nOn Node\\n\\nADM = AOA => 1 Time Estimate\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nOn Arrow\\n\\nLet’s revisit the house-painting example to put all this in perspective. In order to paint, you first need to scrape the peeling paint and then prime. However, you can’t begin painting until the primer has dried, so you shouldn’t schedule priming for Monday and painting for Tuesday if you need the primer to dry on Tuesday. Therefore, the priming activity requires lag time, so you need to add time to the end of this activity to allow for the drying time needed before you can start painting.\\n\\nLead time works just the opposite. Suppose, for this example, you could start priming before the scraping is finished. Maybe there are areas on the house that don’t require scraping, so you don’t really need to wait until the scraping activity finishes to begin the priming activity. Prim- ing in this example has lead time subtracted from the beginning of the activity so that this activ- ity begins prior to the previous activity finishing.\\n\\nActivity Sequencing Outputs\\n\\nHere are the outputs of the Activity Sequencing process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject schedule network diagrams\\n\\nActivity list updates\\n\\nActivity attributes updates\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\n3601.book  Page 240  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n240\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nWe’ve just spent a good deal of time describing the different types of project schedule network diagrams you can construct using PDM or ADM techniques. Project schedule network diagrams can be generated on a computer, or you can draw them out by hand. Like the WBS, these diagrams may contain all the project details or may contain only summary-level details, depending on the complexity of the project. Summary-level activities are a collection of related activities also known as hammocks. Think of hammocks as a group of related activities rolled up into a summary head- ing that describes the activities likely to be contained in that grouping.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the construction of these project schedule network diagrams might bring activities to light that you missed when defining your activity list, or it might make you break an activity down into two activities in places where you thought one activity might work. If this is the case, you will produce both activity list updates based on this new information as well as activity attributes updates.\\n\\nAfter the activities are sequenced, the next steps involve estimating the resources and esti- mating the durations of the activities so that they can be plugged into the project schedule. We’ll look at these topics in the next chapter.\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\n“Thanks everyone for your timely responses. I’ll look over your list of roles and responsibilities, skills needed for the activities, and your activity lists.” The meeting adjourns, and you head back to your office to review the documents. You’d like to get the project schedule constructed soon and go over it with Dirk.\\n\\nRicardo Ramirez from the IT department has outlined his resource needs and activity list. He reminds you that data is sent from each store over a T1 connection, not over satellite as Jill told you originally. Ricardo’s activities are as follows.

Jill mentioned she needs some lead time to stock shelves and that might interfere with the store build-out activity assigned to Jake’s team. I don’t have enough information yet to finish this. I need to get some time and cost estimates from everyone before I know for sure if there’s a problem.”\\n\\n“I’d rather know sooner than later if there’s a problem, so get right on those estimates.”\\n\\nYou toggle over to the calendaring system and see all three stakeholders are free Thursday morning.

Be cer- tain you understand its inputs and tools and techniques well. Then again, remember the exam is randomly generated from a pool of questions, so don’t ever concentrate all your memoriza- tion efforts on only one or two processes.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis chapter’s focus was on planning for project resources. There are several aspects involved in these planning activities, including procurement of goods and services, human resource plan- ning, and defining the activities human resources will be involved in.\\n\\nWe started out with the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. This process identifies the\\n\\ngoods or services you’re going to purchase from outside of the organization and determines which project needs can be met by the project team. This involves tools and techniques like make-or-buy decisions, expert judgment, and contract types. The procurement management plan is one of the outputs of this process and describes how procurement services will be man- aged throughout the project. The contract statement of work (another output of this process) describes the work that will be contracted out.\\n\\nPlan Contracting creates the documents you’ll use to procure the goods and services needed\\n\\nfrom outside the organization.\\n\\nThe Human Resource Planning process identifies and assigns roles and responsibilities and reporting relationships. Many times the roles and responsibilities assignments are depicted in a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) or a RACI chart. The staffing management plan describes how and when project team members will be acquired is an output of the Human Resource Planning process.\\n\\nThe Activity Definition process involves decomposing the work packages into individual units of work called schedule activities that can be easily assigned and estimated. The output of this process is the activity list, activity attributes, milestone list, and requested changes.\\n\\nThe Activity Sequencing process takes the activities and puts them in a logical, sequential order based on dependencies. Dependencies exist when the current activity is reliant on some action from a predecessor activity or it impacts a successor activity. There are three types of dependencies: mandatory, discretionary, and external. PDM (also known as AON) and ADM (also known as AOA) are two methods for displaying project schedule network diagrams. PDM has four logical relationships, or dependencies: finish-to-start, start-to-finish, finish-to-finish, and start-to-start.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 243  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\n243\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to name the purpose for the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. The purpose of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process is to identify which project needs should be obtained from outside the organization. Make–or-buy analysis is used as a tool and technique to help determine this.\\n\\nBe able to identify the contract types and their usage. Contract types are a tool and technique of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process and include fixed price and cost reimbursable con- tracts. Use fixed price contracts for well-defined projects with a high value to the company, and use cost reimbursable contracts for projects with uncertainty and large investments early in the project life. The three types of cost reimbursable contracts are CPF (or CPPC), CPFF, and CPIF. Time and materials contracts are a cross between fixed and cost reimbursable contracts.\\n\\nBe able to name the outputs of the Plan Contracting process. The outputs of Plan Contract- ing are procurement documents, evaluation criteria, and contract statement of work updates.\\n\\nBe able to name the purpose of the Human Resource Planning process. Human Resource Planning involves determining roles and responsibilities, reporting relationships for the project, and creating the staffing management plan, which describes how team members are acquired and the criteria for their release.\\n\\nBe able to name the purpose of the Activity Definition process. The Activity Definition pro- cess decomposes the work packages into schedule activities and creates an activity list, activity attributes, a milestone list, and requested changes as its outputs.\\n\\nBe able to identify the tools and techniques of Activity Sequencing. The tools and techniques of Activity Sequencing are the precedence diagramming method (PDM), the arrow diagram- ming method (ADM), schedule network templates, dependency determination, and applying leads and lags.\\n\\nBe able to discuss the difference between PDM and ADM. PDM (also known as AON) dis- plays activity on nodes with connecting arrows showing dependencies. PDM has four logical relationships and uses the finish-to-start relationship most often. ADM (also known as AOA) displays activities on arrows with connecting nodes showing dependencies and uses only the finish-to-start relationship.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 244  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n244\\n\\nChapter 6 (cid:2) Resource Planning\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

Grapevine wants you to design an Internet wine club for its customers. Customers must register before being allowed to order wine over the Internet so that legal age can be established. You know that the module to ver- ify registration must be written and tested using data from Grapevine’s existing database. This new module cannot be tested until the data from the existing system is loaded. You are going to hire a vendor to perform the programming and testing tasks for this module to help speed up the project schedule.

Make-or-buy analysis is determining whether it’s more cost effective to purchase the goods or services needed for the project or more cost effective for the organization to produce them internally.\\n\\n2. C. Fixed price contracts have the highest risk to the seller and the least amount of risk to the\\n\\nbuyer. However, the price the vendor charges for the product or service will compensate for the amount of risk they’re taking on.\\n\\n3. B. The SOW can be written by either the buyer or the seller. Sometimes the buyer will write the SOW and the seller may modify it and send it back to the buyer for verification and approval.\\n\\n4. A. The cost plus incentive fee contract is one that the buyer reimburses the seller for the seller’s allowable costs and includes an incentive or bonus for exceeding the performance criteria laid out in the contract.\\n\\n5. D. The RAM and RACI charts are tools and techniques of this process.\\n\\n6. C. Evaluation criteria can be based on price alone when there are several vendors who can\\n\\nreadily supply the good or services. The question states that only three vendors make the machine, which means evaluation criteria should be based on more than price.\\n\\n7. A.

As a result, a lot of time and effort goes into the Planning processes of any project. You’ll find on some projects that you may spend almost as much time planning the project as you do executing and control- ling it. This isn’t a bad thing. The better planning you do up front, the more likely you’ll have a successful project. Speaking of planning…the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring and Con- trolling process groups together account for almost 70 percent of the PMP exam questions, so plan\\n\\non spending about the same percentage of your study time on these areas.\\n\\nWe have another fun-filled, action-packed chapter. We’re going to pick up from where we left off last chapter and create estimates for our project activities and then wrap up the remain- ing Planning processes. We’ll spend a good deal of time on developing the project schedule and discussing the project budget. These two documents are two of your most important planning documents. Everything we’ve done up to this point will help us create an accurate schedule and budget. You’ll use these documents throughout the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes (along with several other documents we’ve created along the way) to help measure the progress of the project.\\n\\nWe’ll start the Executing process group in the next chapter. But before we do that, let’s get\\n\\na good grasp of the project schedule and budget.\\n\\nActivity Resource Estimating\\n\\nresources\\n\\nin this case does All projects, from the smallest to the largest, require resources. The term A Guide not mean just people; it means all the physical resources required to complete the project. defines resources as people, equipment, and materials. In reality, this includes peo- to the PMBOK ple, equipment, supplies, materials, software, hardware—the list goes on depending on the project you’re working on. resources needed (both human and materials) and in what quantities for each schedule activity within a work package. You might be asking, “Didn’t we already do the people part in the Human Activity Resource Estimating process?” The answer is…no. Remember that Human Activity Resource Estimating determines roles and responsibilities and describes reporting relationships. Activity Resource Estimating determines what types or resources are needed and how many.\\n\\nis concerned with determining the types of\\n\\nActivity Resource Estimating\\n\\nRemember, the activity resource output from this process is an input into the Human Activity Resource Estimating process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 255  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nActivity Resource Estimating\\n\\n255\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nnotes that Activity Resource Estimating should be closely coordi- nated with the Cost Estimating process (we’ll talk about Cost Estimating later in this chapter). That’s because resources—whether people or material or both—are typically the largest expense you’ll have on any project. Identifying the resources becomes a critical component of the project planning process so estimates—and ultimately the project budget—can be accurately derived. We’ll look at the inputs and tools and techniques that will help you document these requirements next.\\n\\nActivity Resource Estimating Inputs\\n\\nThe Activity Resource Estimating process has several inputs you are already familiar with:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nActivity list\\n\\nActivity attributes\\n\\nResource availability\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nThe only one we haven’t seen before is resource availability.\\n\\nResource availability is an output of the Acquire Project Team process. The Acquire Project Team process isn’t performed until the Executing process group, so we’re a little out of order. In practice, you’ll likely perform both Human Resource Planning and Acquire Project Team during the Planning stages of the project. For the exam, remember that resource availability isn’t determined until the Executing stage and becomes an input to the Activity Resource Estimating process.\\n\\nThe resource availability output describes, believe it or not, the time frames in which resources (both human and material) are available. This will help you estimate the types of resources you may need for the project. For example, if you are working on a project that requires the use of spe- cialized equipment during one of the project phases and the resource availability document shows that this equipment isn’t available until sometime after the time frame in which you need it, you know you’ll need to either make schedule adjustments or find another supplier who can provide the equipment when you need it. The same is true for human resources.\\n\\nTools and Techniques for Estimating Activities\\n\\nOur goal with the Activity Resource Estimating process is to determine the activity resource requirements, including quantity and availability. This process has five tools and techniques to help accomplish this output: expert judgment, alternatives analysis, published estimating data,\\n\\n3601.book  Page 256  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n256\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nproject management software, and bottom-up estimating. We already know what expert judg- ment entails, so let’s take a look at the remaining tools:\\n\\nAlternatives analysis is used when thinking about the methods you\\n\\nAlternatives analysis might use to accomplish the activities your resources have been assigned. Many times, there’s more than one way to accomplish an activity, and alternatives analysis helps decide among the possibilities. For example, a subcompact car drives on the same roads a six-figure sports car travels. The sports car has a lot more features than the subcompact, it’s faster, it’s probably more comfortable, and it has a visual appeal that the subcompact doesn’t. The sports car may be the valid resource choice for the project, but there are alternatives you should consider. The same idea applies to human resources in that you might apply senior-level resources versus junior-level or you could add resources to speed up the schedule. You can also consider make- or-buy analysis when determining alternatives.\\n\\nPublished estimating data rates or estimates, production rates, and so on. For example, your organization may have estab- lished price agreements with vendors that outline rates by resource type, or there may be indus- try estimates for production rates for your particular activity.\\n\\nEstimating data may include organizational guidelines, industry\\n\\nProject management software Here we see project management software named as a tool and technique rather than as an organizational asset input. Project management software can help estimate resource needs and document resource availability. It may also produce an RBS, resource rates, calendars, and availability.\\n\\nBottom-up estimating is a process of estimating individual activities or costs Bottom-up estimating and then adding these up together to come up with a total estimate. Here you estimate every schedule activity individually and then roll up that estimate, or add them all together, to come up with a total. This is a very accurate means of estimating provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are accurate. However, it takes a considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because every activity must be assessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation. The smaller and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique.\\n\\nActivity Resource Estimating Outputs\\n\\nAs mentioned, the purpose of the Activity Resource Estimating process is to develop the activity resource requirements output that describes the types of resources and the quantity needed for each schedule activity. Work package estimates are derived from the cumulative total of each schedule activity within the work package. You should also prepare a narrative description for this output that describes how you determined the estimate and the assumptions you made about the resources and their availability.\\n\\nWe’ll use the information from this output in the next process (Activity Duration Estimates) to determine the length of time each activity will take to complete. That, of course, depends on the quantity and skill level of the resources assigned, which is the reason we estimate resources before we try to determine duration.\\n\\nThe remaining outputs of this process are activity attribute updates, resource breakdown structure, resource calendar updates, and requested changes. We’ve covered each of these out- puts previously with the exception of resource calendar updates.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 257  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nEstimating Activity Durations\\n\\n257\\n\\nResource calendars\\n\\nlook at a particular resource or groups of resources and their skills, abil- ities, quantity, and availability. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing resource and the per- son assigned to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in October. The resource calendar would show this person’s vacation schedule. It also shows holidays the company rec- ognizes. Resource calendars also examine the quantity, capability, and availability of equip- ment and material resources that have a potential to impact the project schedule. For example, suppose your project calls for a hydraulic drill and your organization owns only one. The resource calendar will tell you if it’s scheduled for another job at the same time it’s needed for your project. The updates portion of this output refer to updating the resource calendar with changes to any of the elements you’ve recorded here.\\n\\nYou can see how these “Activity” processes have built upon each other. First we defined the activities, then we determined dependencies and sequenced them in the correct order, and next we determined what types and quantities of resources are required to complete the activities. Now we’re ready to begin estimating the duration of these activities so that we can plug them into the project schedule.\\n\\nEstimating Activity Durations\\n\\nactivity duration estimates.\\n\\nActivity Duration Estimating\\n\\nprocess attempts to estimate the work effort, resources, and The number of work periods needed to complete each schedule activity. The primary output of this These are quantifiable estimates expressed as the num- process is the ber of work periods needed to complete a schedule activity. Work periods are usually expressed in hours or days. However, larger projects might express duration in weeks or months. Work periods are the activity duration estimates, and they become inputs to the project schedule in a later process.\\n\\nWhen you’re estimating activity duration, you are estimating the length of time the activity will take to complete, including any elapsed time needed from the beginning to the ending of the activ- ity. For example, let’s look at the house-painting project. You estimate that it will take three days, including drying time, to prime the house. Now, let’s say priming is scheduled to begin on Satur- day, but your crew doesn’t work on Sunday. The activity duration in this case is four days, which includes the three days to prime and dry plus the Sunday the crew doesn’t work. Most project management software programs will handle this kind of situation automatically.\\n\\nProgressive elaboration comes into play during this process also. Estimates typically start out at a fairly high level, and as more and more details are known about the deliverables and their associated activities, the estimates become more accurate. You should rely on those folks who have the most knowledge of the activities you’re trying to estimate to help you with this process.\\n\\nActivity Duration Estimating Inputs\\n\\nThe inputs to this process include enterprise environmental factors, organization process assets, project scope statement, activity list, activity attributes, activity resource requirements, resource calendars, and the project management plan including the risk register and activity cost estimates.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 258  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n258\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nA few of the important elements regarding these inputs apply here as we’ve seen in past pro- cesses, including databases, historical information, constraints, and assumptions. The project calendars (considered a part of the organizational process assets) and activity resource require- ments are especially useful during this process.\\n\\nActivity Duration Estimating Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThere are several new tools and techniques in the Activity Duration Estimating process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nExpert judgment\\n\\nAnalogous estimating\\n\\nParametric estimating\\n\\nThree\\n\\n\\n\\npoint estimates\\n\\nReserve analysis\\n\\nWe’ll take a look at each of these tools and techniques next.\\n\\nExpert Judgment\\n\\nActivities are most accurately estimated by the staff members who will perform them. In this case, expert judgment is used by team members because of their experience with similar activ- ities in the past. You should be careful with these estimates, though, as they are subject to bias and aren’t based on any scientific means. Your experts should consider that resource levels, resource productivity, resource capability, risks, and other factors can impact estimates. It’s good practice to combine expert judgment with historical information and use as many experts as you can.\\n\\nAnalogous Estimating aka Top\\n\\n\\n\\ndown Estimating\\n\\nalso called\\n\\ntop\\n\\n\\n\\ndown estimating,\\n\\nis a form of expert judgment. With this Analogous estimating, technique, you will use the actual duration of a similar activity completed on a previous project to determine the duration of the current activity—provided the information was documented and stored with the project information on the previous project. This technique is most useful when the previous activities you’re comparing are similar to the activity you’re estimating and don’t just appear to be similar. And you want the folks who are working on the estimate to have experience with these activities so they can provide reasonable estimates. This technique is espe- cially helpful when detailed information about the project is not available, such as in the early phases of the project.\\n\\nTop-down estimating techniques are also used to estimate total project duration, particularly when you have a limited amount of information about the project. The best way to think about top- down techniques is to look at the estimate as a whole. Think about being on a mountaintop where you can see the whole picture as one rather than all the individual items that make up the picture. For instance, let’s go back to the house-painting example. You would compare a previous house-painting project to the current house-painting project, where the houses are of similar size and the paint you’re using is the same quality. The first house-painting project can be used\\n\\n3601.book  Page 259  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nEstimating Activity Durations\\n\\n259\\n\\nto estimate the project duration for the second house-painting project because of the similarities in the project.\\n\\nTop-down techniques are useful when you’re early on in the project Planning processes and are only just beginning to flesh out all the details of the project. Sometimes during the project selection process, the selection committee may want an idea of the project’s duration. You can derive a project estimate at this stage by using top-down techniques.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK project duration. during the Schedule Development process, not the Activity Duration Estimating process.\\n\\nstates that you can also use analogous estimating to determine overall (this is the key word), calculating overall project duration is performed\\n\\nHowever\\n\\nParametric Estimating\\n\\nParametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the quantity of work by the rate. The best way to describe it with is with an example. Suppose you are work- ing on a companywide network upgrade project. This requires you to run new cable to the switches on every floor in the building. Parametric estimates can be used to determine activity duration estimates by taking a known element—in this case, the amount of cable needed—and multiplying it by the amount of time it takes to install a unit of cable to come up with an esti- mate. In other words, suppose you have 10,000 meters of new cable to run. You know from past experience it takes one hour to install 100 meters. Using this measurement, you can deter- mine an estimate for this activity of 100 hours to run the new cable. Therefore, the cable activity duration estimate is 100 hours.\\n\\nThree\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint Estimates\\n\\n, as you can probably guess, use three estimates that are averaged to come\\n\\nThree-point estimates up with a final estimate. The three estimates are the most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic. You’ll want to rely on experienced folks to give you these estimates. The most likely estimate assumes there are no disasters and the activity can be completed as planned. The optimistic esti- mate is the fastest time frame in which your resource can complete the activity. And the pessi- mistic estimate assumes the worst happens and it takes much longer than planned to get the activity completed. These three estimates are averaged to come up with an overall estimate.\\n\\nWe’ll look more closely at this tool and technique later in this chapter in the sec- tion “Schedule Development Tools and Techniques.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 260  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n260\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nReserve Analysis\\n\\nin\\n\\nor\\n\\nbuffer\\n\\n—also called\\n\\ncontingency time\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nReserve time — means add- ing a portion of time to the activity to account for schedule risk. You might choose to add a per- centage of time or a set number of work periods to the activity or the overall schedule. For example, you know it will take 100 hours to run new cable based on the quantitative estimate you came up with earlier. You also know that sometimes you hit problem areas when running the cable. To make sure you don’t impact the project schedule, you build in a reserve time of 10 percent of your original estimate to account for the problems you might encounter. This brings your activity duration estimate to 110 hours for this activity.\\n\\nDesert State University (DSU)\\n\\nDSU has hired a contract agency to create its new registration website. The website will allow students in good academic standing to register for classes over the Internet. You have been appointed the project manager for the DSU side of this project. You’ll be working with Henry Lu from Web Sites International to complete this project.\\n\\nHenry has given you an activity list and asked for time estimates that he can plug into the project plan.\\n\\nYour first stop is Mike Walter’s desk. He’s the expert on the mainframe registration system and will be writing the interface programs to accept registration data from the new website. Mike will also create the download that the Internet program will use to verify students’ academic stand- ing. Mike has created other programs just like this in the past. His expertise and judgment are very reliable.\\n\\nThe next stop is Kate Langdon. She’s the new team leader over the testing group. Kate has been with DSU for only one month. Since she has no experience working with DSU data and staff members, she tells you she’ll get back to you within a week with estimates for the testing activ- ities. She plans to read through the project binders of some similar projects and base her esti- mates against the historical information on similar projects. She’ll run the estimates by her lead tester before giving them to you.\\n\\nYou’ve asked both of your resources to provide you with three-point estimates. Mike Walter’s estimates are an example of using the tool and technique of expert judgment to derive activity duration estimates. The estimates expected from Kate Langdon will be derived using historical information (implied by the research she’s going to do into past similar projects) and expert judgment because she’s involving her lead tester to verify the estimates.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 261  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n261\\n\\nActivity Duration Estimating Outputs\\n\\nEverything we’ve talked about up to this point has brought us to the primary output of this pro- cess: the activity duration estimates. The inputs and tools and techniques are used to establish these estimates. As mentioned in the opening of this section, activity duration estimates are an estimate of the required work periods needed to complete the activity. This is a quantitative measure usually expressed in hours, weeks, days, or months.\\n\\nOne thing to note about your final estimates as an output to this process is that they should contain a range of possible results. In the cable-running example, you would state the activity duration estimates as “100 hours ± 10 hours” to show that the actual duration will take at least 90 hours and may go as long as 110 hours. Or you could use percentages to express this range. The other output of Activity Duration Estimating is activity attribute updates. You will update the activity attributes with the duration estimate and the assumptions you used when deriving the estimates.\\n\\nNow that we have all the activity information in hand, along with a host of other inputs,\\n\\nwe’re ready to develop the project schedule.\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\nSchedule Development\\n\\nThe process is the heart of the Planning process group. This is where you lay out the schedule for your project activities, determine their start and finish dates, and finalize activity sequences and durations. This process, along with Activity Resource Estimating and Activity Duration Estimating, is repeated several times before you actually come up with the project for the project that schedule. The project schedule, once it’s approved, serves as the you can track against in later processes.\\n\\nschedule baseline\\n\\nYou’ll learn later in this section that project management software comes in very handy dur-\\n\\ning this process. In fact, it is one of the tools and techniques of this process.\\n\\nAlthough there are no exam questions regarding the order in which the processes are performed, it might help to understand that Schedule Development cannot be performed until all of the following processes of project Planning are completed: Scope Planning, Scope Definition, Create WBS, Risk Identification, Risk Response Planning, Plan Purchases and Acquisitions, Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Definition, Activity Sequencing, and Activity Duration Estimating.\\n\\nIt’s interesting to note that there is a schedule management plan but it isn’t created during A Guide this process, nor is it an output of this process as other management plans have been. notes that the schedule management plan (a subsidiary of the project manage- to the PMBOK ment plan) is produced as part of the Develop Project Management Plan process and contains the criteria for formatting, developing, and controlling the project schedule.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 262  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n262\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2)\\n\\nCreating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nWe’ve got a lot of material to cover in this process. We’ll start out with the inputs to the Schedule Development process and then follow up with an in-depth discussion of the tools and techniques of the process. These techniques will help you get to the primary output of this pro- cess, which is the project schedule.\\n\\nSchedule Development Inputs\\n\\nSchedule Development has nine inputs, seven of which are outputs from other Planning pro- cesses. The inputs are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\nActivity list\\n\\nActivity attributes\\n\\nProject schedule network diagrams\\n\\nActivity resource requirements\\n\\nResource calendars\\n\\nActivity duration estimates\\n\\nProject management plan (risk register)\\n\\nYou can see how important it is to perform all of the Planning processes accurately because the information you derive from almost every process in the Planning group is used somewhere else in Planning, many of them here. Your project schedule will reflect the information you know at this point in time. If you have incorrectly estimated activity durations or didn’t identify the right dependencies, for example, the inputs to this process will be distorted and your project schedule will not be correct. It’s definitely worth the investment of time to correctly plan your project and come up with accurate outputs for each of the Planning processes.\\n\\nAs with several other processes, constraints and assumptions are highlighted as the elements of the project scope statement to pay particular attention to. Constraints are with you through- out the life of the project. The most important constraints to consider in the Schedule Develop- the time constraints ment process are time constraints. According to in this process fall into two categories: imposed dates and key events or major milestones.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nImposed dates are used to restrict the start or finish date of activities. The two most common constraints used to restrict dates are enforced by most computerized project management soft- ware programs. They are “start no earlier than” and “finish no later than” constraints. For example, let’s go back to Chapter 6’s house-painting example. The painting activity cannot start until the primer has dried. If the primer takes 24 hours to dry and is scheduled to be completed Thursday. This is an on Wednesday, this implies the painting activity can example of an imposed date.\\n\\nstart no earlier than\\n\\nKey events or milestones refer to the completion of specific deliverables by a specific date. Stake- holders, customers, or management staff may request that certain deliverables be completed or deliv- ered by specific dates. Once you’ve agreed to those dates (even if the agreement is only verbal), it’s often cast in stone and very difficult to change. These dates, therefore, become constraints.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 263  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n263\\n\\nBe careful of the delivery dates you commit to your stakeholders or customers. You may think you’re simply discussing the matter or throwing out ideas, while the stakeholder may take what you’ve said as fact. Once the stakeholder believes the deliverable or activity will be completed by a specific date, there’s almost no convincing them that the date needs changing.\\n\\nSchedule Development Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThe primary output of Schedule Development is the project schedule. You can employ several tools and techniques in order to produce this output. The tools and techniques you choose will depend on the complexity of the project. For the exam, however, you’ll need to know them all.\\n\\nThere are 10 tools and techniques used in Schedule Development:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSchedule network analysis\\n\\nCritical path method\\n\\nSchedule compression\\n\\nWhat\\n\\n\\n\\nif scenario analysis\\n\\nResource leveling\\n\\nCritical chain method\\n\\nProject management software\\n\\nApplying calendars\\n\\nAdjusting leads and lags\\n\\nSchedule model\\n\\nA lot of information is packed into some of these tools and techniques, and you should dedicate study time to each of them for the exam. A few of these inputs were discussed earlier but they have new twists in the Schedule Development process so we’ll take a look at each of them next.\\n\\nSchedule Network Analysis\\n\\nSchedule network analysis produces the project schedule. It involves calculating early and late start dates and early and late finish dates for project activities (as does the critical path method). It uses a schedule model and other analytical techniques such as critical path and critical chain method, what-if analysis, and resource leveling (all of which are other tools and techniques in this process) to help calculate these dates and create the schedule. These calculations are per- formed without taking resource limitations into consideration, so the dates you end up with are theoretical. What you’re attempting to establish at this point is the time periods within which the activities can be scheduled. Resource limitations and other constraints will be taken into consideration when you get to the outputs of this process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 264  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n264\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nCritical Path Method\\n\\nCritical path method (CPM) is a schedule network analysis technique. It determines the amount of float, or schedule flexibility, for each of the network paths by calculating the earliest start date, earliest finish date, latest start date, and latest finish date for each activity. This is a sched- ule network analysis technique that relies on sequential networks (one activity occurs before the next, or a series of activities occurring concurrently are completed before the next series of activ- ities, and so on) and on a single duration estimate for each activity. Keep in mind that CPM is a method to determine schedule durations without regard to resource availability.\\n\\nThe critical path (CP) is generally the longest full path on the project. Any project activity with a float time that equals zero is considered a critical path task. The critical path can end under a few conditions. When activities with float time use up all their float, they can become critical path tasks. Or you may have a milestone midway through the project with a finish-no- later-than constraint that can change the critical path if it isn’t met.\\n\\nFloat time is also called slack time, and you’ll see these terms used interchangeably. There are two types of float: total float and free float. Total float (TF) is the amount of time you can delay the earliest start of a task without delaying the ending of the project. Free float (FF) is the amount of time you can delay the start of a task without delaying the early start of a successor task.\\n\\nIn the following section, you’ll calculate the CP for a sample project and illustrate how all the\\n\\ndates, the CP, and the float times are derived.\\n\\nGathering Activity and Dependency Information\\n\\nLet’s say you are the project manager for a new software project. The company you are working for is venturing into the movie rental business over the Web. You need to devise a software sys- tem that tracks all the information related to rentals and also supplies the management team with reports that will help them make good business decisions. For purposes of illustration, I’m showing only a limited portion of the tasks that you would have on a project like this.\\n\\nYou’ll start this example by plugging information from the processes you’ve already com- pleted into a table (a complete example is shown later in Table 7.1 in the section “Calculating the Critical Path”). The list of activities comes from the Activity Definition process. The dura- tions for each activity are listed in the Duration column and were derived during the Activity Duration Estimating process. The duration times are listed in days.\\n\\nThe Dependency column lists the activities that require a previous activity to finish before the current activity can start. You’re using only finish-to-start relationships. For example, you’ll see that activity number 2 and activity number 4 each depend on activity 1 to finish before they can begin. The dependency information came from the Activity Sequencing process. Now, you’ll proceed to calculating the dates.\\n\\nCalculating the Forward and Backward Pass\\n\\nProject Deliverables is the first activity and, obviously, where the project starts. This activity begins on April 1. Project Deliverables has a 12-day duration. So take April 1 and add 12 days to this to come up with an early finish date of April 12. Watch out, because you need to count day one, or April 1, as a full work day. The simplest way to do this calculation is to take the early start date, add the duration, and subtract one. Therefore, the early finish date for the first\\n\\n3601.book  Page 265  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n265\\n\\nactivity is April 12. By the way, we are ignoring weekends and holidays for this example. Activ- ity 2 depends on activity 1, so it cannot start until activity 1 has finished. Its earliest start date is April 13. Add the duration to this date minus one to come up with the finish date.\\n\\nYou’ll notice that activity 4 depends on activity 1 finishing, so its earliest start date is also April 13. Continue to calculate the remaining early start and early finish dates in the same man- ner. This calculation is called a forward pass.\\n\\nTo calculate the late start and late finish dates, you begin with the last activity. The late finish for activity 9 is July 10. Since the duration is only one day, July 10 is also the late start date. You know that activity 8 must finish before activity 9 can begin, so activity 8’s late finish date, July 9, is one day prior to activity 9’s late start date, July 10. Subtract the duration of activity 8 (three days) from July 9 and add one to get the late start date of July 7. You’re performing the opposite calculation that you did for the forward pass. This calculation is called a backward pass, as you might have guessed. Continue calculating the late start and late finish through activity 4.\\n\\nActivity 3 adds a new twist. Here’s how it works. Activity 7 cannot begin until activity 3 and activity 6 are completed. No other activity depends on the completion of activity 3. If activity 7’s late start date is June 29, activity 3’s late finish date must be June 28. June 28 minus eight days plus one gives you a late start date of June 21. Activity 3 depends on activity 2, so activity 2 must be completed prior to beginning activity 3. Calculate these dates just as you did for activ- ities 9 through 4.\\n\\nActivity 1 still remains. Activity 4 cannot start until activity 1 is completed. If activity 4’s late start date is April 13, the late finish date for activity 1 must be April 12. Subtract the duration of activity 1 and add one to come up with a late start date of April 1. Alternatively, the forward pass and backward pass can be calculated by saying the first task starts on day zero and then adding the duration to this. For example, activity number 1’s early start date is April 1, which is day zero. Add 12 days to day zero and you come up with an early finish date of April 12.\\n\\nThe calculation for float/slack time is determined by subtracting the early start date from the\\n\\nlate start date. If the float time equals zero, the activity is on the critical path.\\n\\nCalculating the Critical Path\\n\\nTo determine the CP duration of the project, add up the duration of every activity with zero float. You should come up with 101 days because you’re adding the duration for all activities except for activity 2 and activity 3. A critical path task is any task that cannot be changed with- out impacting the project end date. By definition, these are all tasks with zero float.\\n\\nAnother way to determine the critical path is by looking at the network diagram. If the dura- tion is included with the information on the node, or if start and end dates are given, you simply calculate the duration and then add up the duration of the longest path in the diagram to deter- mine the CP. However, this method is not as accurate as what’s shown in Table 7.1. Figure 7.1 shows the same project in diagram form. Duration is printed in the top-right corner of each node. Add up the duration of each path to determine which one is the critical path.\\n\\nRemember that CP is usually the path with the longest duration. In Figure 7.1, path 1-2-3-7-8-9 equals 34 days. Path 1-4-5-6-7-8-9 equals 101 days; therefore, this path is the critical path.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 266  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n266\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nT A B L E 7 . 1\\n\\nCPM Calculation\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nNumber\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nDependency Duration\\n\\nEarly\\n\\nStart\\n\\nEarly\\n\\nFinish\\n\\nLate\\n\\nStart\\n\\nLate\\n\\nFinish\\n\\nFloat/\\n\\nSlack\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\nProject\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\n—\\n\\n12\\n\\n4/1\\n\\n4/12\\n\\n4/1\\n\\n4/12\\n\\n0\\n\\nProcure\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTest\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nProcure\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nTools\\n\\nWrite\\n\\nPrograms\\n\\nTest and\\n\\nDebug\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\nInstall\\n\\n3, 6\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nAcceptance\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n2\\n\\n8\\n\\n4/13\\n\\n4/14\\n\\n6/19\\n\\n6/20\\n\\n68\\n\\n4/15\\n\\n4/22\\n\\n6/21\\n\\n6/28\\n\\n68\\n\\n10\\n\\n4/13\\n\\n4/22\\n\\n4/13\\n\\n4/22\\n\\n45\\n\\n22\\n\\n8\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n4/23\\n\\n6/6\\n\\n4/23\\n\\n6/6\\n\\n6/7\\n\\n6/28\\n\\n6/7\\n\\n6/28\\n\\n6/29\\n\\n7/6\\n\\n6/29\\n\\n7/7\\n\\n7/9\\n\\n7/7\\n\\n7/6\\n\\n7/9\\n\\n7/10\\n\\n7/10\\n\\n7/10\\n\\n7/10\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\nExpected Value Using PERT\\n\\nProgram Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a method that isn’t discussed in A Guide to the PMBOK but you may encounter on the exam. The PERT was developed in the 1950s by the United States Navy. They were working on one of the most complex engineering projects in history at the time—the Polaris Missile Program—and needed a way to manage the project and forecast the project schedule with a high degree of reliability. PERT was devel- oped to do just that.\\n\\nPERT and CPM are similar techniques. The difference is that CPM uses the most likely duration to determine project duration, while PERT uses what’s called expected value (or the weighted average). Expected value is calculated using the three-point estimates for activity duration (we talked about three-point estimates earlier in this chapter) and then finding the weighted average of those estimates. If you take this one step further and determine the stan- dard deviation of each activity, you can assign a confidence factor to your project estimates. Without getting too heavily involved in the mathematics of probability, understand that for\\n\\n3601.book  Page 267  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n267\\n\\ndata that fits a bell curve, which is what you’re about to calculate with the PERT technique, the following is true:\\n\\n(cid:2) Work will finish within plus or minus three standard deviations 99.73 percent of the time.\\n\\n(cid:2) Work will finish within plus or minus two standard deviations 95.44 percent of the time.\\n\\n(cid:2) Work will finish within plus or minus one standard deviation 68.26 percent of the time.\\n\\nF I G U R E 7 . 1\\n\\nCritical path diagram\\n\\nAct #2\\n\\n2\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nAct #3\\n\\n8\\n\\nTest Hardware\\n\\nAct #1\\n\\n12\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\nAct #4\\n\\n10\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nAct #7\\n\\nAct #8\\n\\nAct #9\\n\\n8\\n\\nInstall\\n\\n3\\n\\nTraining\\n\\n1\\n\\nAcceptance\\n\\nAct #5\\n\\nAct #6\\n\\n45\\n\\nWrite Code\\n\\n22\\n\\nTest & Debug\\n\\nCalculating Expected Value\\n\\nThe three-point estimates used to calculate expected value are the optimistic estimate, the pes- simistic estimate, and the most likely estimate. Going back to the software example, let’s find out what these three time estimates might look like for the activity called Write Programs. You get these estimates by asking the lead programmer, or key team member, to estimate the opti- mistic, pessimistic, and most likely duration for the activity based on their past experience. Other historical information could be used to determine these estimates as well. Say in this case that you’re given 38 days for the optimistic time, 57 days for the pessimistic, and 45 days for the most likely. (45 days was derived from the Activity Duration Estimating process and is the estimate you used to calculate CPM.)\\n\\nThe formula to calculate expected value is as follows:\\n\\n(optimistic + pessimistic + (4 × most likely)) ÷ 6\\n\\nThe expected value for the Write Programs activity is as follows:\\n\\n(38 + 57 + (4 × 45)) ÷ 6 = 45.83\\n\\n3601.book  Page 268  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n268\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nThe formula for standard deviation, which helps you determine confidence level, is as follows:\\n\\n(pessimistic – optimistic) ÷ 6\\n\\nThe standard deviation for your activity is as follows:\\n\\n(57 – 38) ÷ 6 = 3.17\\n\\nYou could say the following given the information you now have:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThere is a 68.26 percent chance that the Write Programs activity will be completed in 42.66 days to 49 days.\\n\\nThere is a 95.44 percent chance that the Write Programs activity will be completed in 39.49 days to 52.17 days.\\n\\nYou calculated the range of dates for the 68.26 percent chance by adding and subtracting one standard deviation, 3.17, from the expected value, 45.83. The 95.44 percent chance was calcu- lated by multiplying the standard deviation times 2, which equals 6.34, and adding and sub- tracting that result from the expected value to come up with the least number of days and the most number of days it will take to finish the activity. Generally speaking, two standard devi- ations, or 95.44 percent, is a close enough estimate for most purposes.\\n\\nThe higher the standard deviation is for an activity, the higher the risk. Since standard deviation measures the difference between the pessimistic and the optimistic times, a greater spread between the two, which results in a higher number, indicates a greater risk. Conversely, a low standard deviation means less risk.\\n\\nDetermining Date Ranges for Project Duration\\n\\nLet’s bring your table of activities back and plug in the expected values and the standard devi- ation for each (please see Table 7.2).\\n\\nNow let’s look at the total project duration using PERT and the standard deviation to deter- mine a range of dates for project duration. You should add only the tasks that are on the critical path. Remember from the CPM example that tasks 2 and 3 are not on the critical path, so their expected value and standard deviation calculations have been left blank in this table. When you add all the remaining tasks, the total expected value duration is 102.99 days, or 103 days rounded to the nearest day.\\n\\nYour next logical conclusion might be to add the Standard Deviation column to get the stan-\\n\\ndard deviation for the project. Unfortunately, you cannot add up the standard deviations because you will come out with a number that is much too high. Totaling the standard devia- tions assumes that all of the tasks will run over schedule, and that’s not likely. It is likely that a few tasks will run over, but not every one of them. So now you’re probably wondering how to calculate the magic number.\\n\\nYou might have noticed an extra column at the right called SD Squared. This is the standard\\n\\ndeviation squared—or for those of you with math phobias out there, the standard deviation multiplied by itself.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 269  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n269\\n\\nT A B L E 7 . 2\\n\\nPERT Calculation\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nNumber\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nOptimistic Pessimistic\\n\\nMost\\n\\nLikely\\n\\nExpected\\n\\nValue\\n\\nStandard\\n\\nDeviation\\n\\nSD\\n\\nSquared\\n\\nProject\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\nProcure\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTest\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nProcure\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\nTools\\n\\nWrite\\n\\nPrograms\\n\\nTest and\\n\\nDebug\\n\\nInstall\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nAcceptance\\n\\n10\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n8\\n\\n38\\n\\n20\\n\\n5\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\nTotals for\\n\\nCP tasks\\n\\n14\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n14\\n\\n57\\n\\n30\\n\\n10\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n12\\n\\n12.00\\n\\n0.67\\n\\n0.45\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n10\\n\\n10.33\\n\\n1.00\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n45\\n\\n22\\n\\n8\\n\\n3\\n\\n1\\n\\n45.83\\n\\n3.17\\n\\n10.05\\n\\n23.00\\n\\n1.67\\n\\n2.79\\n\\n7.83\\n\\n3.00\\n\\n1.00\\n\\n0.83\\n\\n0.69\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n102.99\\n\\n14.98\\n\\nOnce you have calculated the standard deviation squared for each activity, add up the squares, for a total of 14.98. There’s one more step and you’re done. Take the square root of 14.98 (you’ll need a calculator) to come up with 3.87. This is the standard deviation you will use to determine your range of projected completion dates. Here’s a recap of these last few calculations:\\n\\nTotal expected value = 103.00\\n\\nSum of SD Squared = 14.98\\n\\nSquare root of SD Squared = 3.87\\n\\nYou can now make the following predictions regarding your project:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThere is a 68.26 percent chance that the project will be completed in 99.13 days to 106.87 days.\\n\\nThere is a 95.44 percent chance that the project will be completed in 95.26 days to 110.74 days.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 270  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n270\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, I recommend that you know that one standard deviation gives you a 68 percent (rounded) probability and two standard deviations gives you a 95 percent (rounded) probability. Also know how to calculate the range of project duration dates based on the expected value and standard deviation calculation. You probably don’t need to memorize how to calculate the standard deviation, because I believe most of the questions give you this information. You should, however, memorize the PERT formula and know how it works. It wouldn’t hurt to go ahead and memorize the standard deviation formula as well—you never know what might show up on the exam.\\n\\nPERT is not used very often today. When it is, it’s used for very large, highly complex projects. However, PERT is a useful technique to determine project duration when your activity durations are uncertain. It’s also useful for calculating the duration for individual tasks in your schedule that may be very complex or risky. You might decide to use PERT for a handful of the activities, those with the highest amount of risk for example, and use other techniques to deter- mine duration for the remaining activities.\\n\\nSchedule Compression\\n\\nSchedule compression is a form of mathematical analysis that’s used to shorten the project schedule without changing the project scope. Compression is simply shortening the project schedule to accomplish all the activities sooner than estimated.\\n\\nSchedule compression might happen when the project end date has been predetermined or if after performing the CPM or PERT techniques, you discover that the project is going to take longer than the original promised date. In the CPM example, you calculated the end date to be July 10. What if the project was undertaken and a July 2 date was promised? That’s when you’ll need to employ one of two duration compression techniques called crashing and fast tracking.\\n\\nCrashing\\n\\nCrashing is a compression technique that looks at cost and schedule trade-offs. One of the things you might do to crash the schedule is add resources—from either inside or outside the organization—to the critical path tasks. It wouldn’t help you to add resources to noncritical path tasks, as these tasks don’t impact the schedule end date anyway because they have float time. You might also limit or reduce the project requirements. Ask stakeholders if the features or functions are “nice to have” or necessary. You might also try changing the sequence of tasks. This sometimes shortens the schedule but isn’t always possible.\\n\\nFast Tracking\\n\\nWe talked about fast tracking in Chapter 1, “What Is a Project?” Fast tracking is starting at the same time two tasks that were previously scheduled to start sequentially. Fast tracking can increase project risk and might cause the project team to have to rework tasks. For example, fast tracking is often performed in object-oriented programming. The programmers might begin writing code on several modules at once, out of sequential order and prior to the completion of the design phase.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 271  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n271\\n\\nBe certain to check the critical path when you’ve used the crashing technique because crashing might have changed the critical path. Also consider that crashing doesn’t always come up with a reasonable result. It often increases the costs of the project as well. The idea with crashing is to try to gain the great- est amount of schedule compression with the least amount of cost.\\n\\nWhat\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Scenario Analysis\\n\\nWhat-if scenario analysis uses different sets of activity assumptions to produce multiple project durations. For example, what would happen if a major deliverable was delayed or the weather prevents you from completing a deliverable on time? What-if analysis weighs these questions and their assumptions and determines the feasibility of the project schedule under these conditions. Simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo analysis use a range of probable activity durations for each activity, and those ranges are then used to calculate a range of probable duration results for the project itself. Monte Carlo runs the possible activity durations and schedule projections many, many times to come up with the schedule projections and their probability, critical path duration estimates, and float time.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, remember that Monte Carlo is a simulation technique that shows the probability of all the possible project completion dates.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nResource leveling can cause the original critical path to change.\\n\\nResource Leveling\\n\\nEarlier, I said that CPM and PERT do not consider resource availability. Now that you have a schedule of activities and have determined the critical path, it’s time to plug in resources for those activities and adjust the schedule according to any resource constraints you discover.\\n\\nResource leveling—also called the resource-based method—is used when resources are lim- ited or time constrained (especially those assigned to critical path activities) and when specific schedule dates need to be met.\\n\\nRemember that you identified resources and resource estimates during the Human Resource\\n\\nPlanning and Activity Resource Estimating processes. Now during Schedule Development, resources are assigned to specific activities. Usually, you’ll find that your initial schedule has\\n\\n3601.book  Page 272  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n272\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nperiods of time with more activities than you have resources to work on them. You will also find that it isn’t always possible to assign 100 percent of your team members’ time to tasks. Some- times your schedule will show a team member who is overallocated, meaning they’re assigned to more work than they can physically perform in the given time period. Other times, they might not be assigned enough work to keep them busy during the time period. This problem is easy to fix. You can assign underallocated resources to multiple tasks to keep them busy.\\n\\nResource Assignments\\n\\nHaving overallocated resources is a little more difficult problem to resolve. Resource leveling attempts to smooth out the resource assignments to get tasks completed without overloading the individual while trying to keep the project on schedule. This typically takes the form of allo- cating resources to critical path tasks first.\\n\\nThere are several ways the project manager can accomplish resource leveling. You might delay the start of a task to match the availability of a key team member. Or you might adjust the resource assignments so that more tasks are given to team members who are underallocated. You could require the resources to work mandatory overtime—that one always goes over well! Perhaps you can split some tasks so that the team member with the pertinent knowledge or skill performs the critical part of the task and the noncritical part of the task is given to a less-skilled team member. All of these methods are forms of resource leveling.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, resource leveling of overallocated team members extends the project end\\n\\ndate. If you’re under a date constraint, you’ll have to go back and rework the schedule after assigning resources to keep the project on track with the committed completion date. This might include moving key resources off of noncritical tasks and assigning them to critical path tasks or adjusting assignments as previously mentioned. Reallocating those team members with slack time to critical path tasks to keep them on schedule is another option. Don’t forget, fast tracking is an option to keep the project on schedule also.\\n\\nReverse Resource Allocation Scheduling\\n\\nReverse resource allocation scheduling is a technique used when key resources—like a thermo- dynamic expert, for example—are required at a specific point in the project and they are the only resource, or resources, available to perform these activities. This technique requires the resources to be scheduled in reverse order (that is, from the end date of the project rather than the beginning) in order to assign this key resource at the correct time.\\n\\nCritical Chain Method\\n\\nCritical chain method is a schedule network analysis technique that accounts for limited or restricted resources when modifying the project schedule. This method typically schedules high risk tasks early in the project so that problems can be identified and addressed right away. It allows for combining several tasks into one task when one resource is assigned to all the tasks. Critical chain uses both deterministic (step-by-step) and probabilistic approaches. There are\\n\\na few steps involved in the critical chain process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nConstruct the schedule network diagram using activity duration estimates (you’ll use non- conservative estimates in this method).\\n\\n3601.book  Page 273  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n273\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDefine dependencies.\\n\\nDefine constraints.\\n\\nCalculate critical path.\\n\\nEnter resource availability into the schedule.\\n\\nOften, the critical path will change once you’ve entered the resource availability. That’s because the critical chain method adds non-work activities where needed as duration buffers to help manage the planned activity durations. After the buffers are added, the planned activities are then scheduled at their latest start and finish dates.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nCPM manages the total float of schedule networks paths, whereas critical chain manages buffer activity durations and resources.\\n\\nProject Management Software\\n\\nGiven the examples you’ve worked through on Schedule Development and resource leveling, you probably already have concluded how much project management software might help you with these processes. Project management software automates the mathematical calculations (like forward and backward pass) and performs resource-leveling functions for you. Obviously, you can then print the schedule that’s been produced for final approval and ongoing updates. It’s common practice to e-mail updated schedules with project notes so that stakeholders know what activities are completed and which ones remain to be done.\\n\\nIt’s beyond the scope of this book to go into all the various software programs available to project managers. Suffice it to say that project management software ranges from the very sim- ple to the very complex. The level of sophistication and the types of project management tech- niques that you’re involved with will determine which software product you should choose. Many project managers that I know have had great success with Microsoft Project software and use it exclusively. It contains a robust set of features and reporting tools that will serve most projects well.\\n\\nDon’t forget that you are the project manager, and your good judgment should never be usurped by the recommendation of a software product. Your finely tuned skills and experience will tell you if relationship issues between team members might cause bigger problems than what the resource-leveling function indicates. Constraints and stakeholder expectations are dif- ficult for a software package to factor in. Rely on your expertise when in doubt. If you don’t have the experience yet to make knowledge-based decisions, seek out another project manager or a senior stakeholder, manager, or team member and ask them to confirm if you’re on the right track. And a word of caution: don’t become so involved with the software that you’re managing the software instead of managing the project. Project management software is a won- derful tool, but it is not a substitute for sound project management practices or experience.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 274  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n274\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nSunny Surgeons, Inc.\\n\\nKate Newman is a project manager for Sunny Surgeons, Inc. Sunny Surgeons is a software company that produces software for handheld display devices for the medical profession. The software allows surgeons to keep notes regarding patients, upcoming surgeries, and ideas about new medicines and techniques to research. Kate’s latest project is to write an enhanced version of the patient-tracking program with system integration capabilities to a well-known desktop software product used by the medical industry.\\n\\nThere has been some recent turnover in the programming department. Fortunately, Stephen, the senior programmer who led the development effort on the original version of the patient tracker, still works for Sunny. His expertise with handheld technologies as well as his knowl- edge of the desktop software product make him an invaluable resource for this project.\\n\\nKate discovered a problem during the development of the project schedule. Stephen is over- allocated for three key activities. Kate decides to see what his take is on the situation before deciding what to do.\\n\\nStephen, the eternal optimist programmer who loves his job and does all but sleep in his office at night, says he can easily complete all the activities and that Kate shouldn’t give it a second thought. He also suggests to Kate that Karen Wong, a junior programmer on his team who worked on the last project with him, might be able to handle the noncritical path task on her own, with a little direction from Stephen.\\n\\nKate thinks better of the idea of overallocating her key project resource, even if he does think he can do the entire thing single-handed. She decides to try some resource leveling to see what that turns up.\\n\\nKate discovers that rearranging the order of activities, along with assigning Karen to handle the noncritical path activity, might be a possible solution. However, this scenario lengthens the project by a total of eight days. Since Kate knows the primary constraint on this project is qual- ity, she’s fairly sure she can get buy-off from the project sponsor and stakeholders on the later schedule date. She can also sell the resource-leveled schedule as a low-risk option as opposed to assigning Stephen to all the activities and keeping the project end date the same. Overallo- cating resources can cause burnout and stress-related illnesses, which will ultimately have a negative impact on the project schedule.\\n\\nApplying Calendars\\n\\nCalendars are divided into two types: project calendars and resource calendars. Project calendars concern all the resources involved in the project and specify the working periods for those resources. For example, if your project work will be completed during normal working hours, the project\\n\\n3601.book  Page 275  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n275\\n\\ncalendar shows work periods from Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 AM and 5 PM. Project calendars are also a part of the organizational process input for this process.\\n\\nResource calendars look at a particular resource or groups of resources and their availability, which were discussed earlier in this chapter. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing resource and the person assigned to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in October. The resource calendar would show this person’s vacation schedule.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nKnow the difference between project calendars and resource calendars for the exam.\\n\\nAdjusting Leads and Lags\\n\\nWe talked about leads and lags in Chapter 6. You’ll recall that lags delay successor activities and require time added either to the start date or to the finish date of the activity you’re scheduling. Leads require time to be subtracted from the start date or the finish date of the activity. Keep in mind that as you go about creating your project schedule, you may need to adjust lead and lag time to come up with a workable schedule.\\n\\nSchedule Model\\n\\nSchedule model is a tool that you use to create your project schedule. You can think of this as a template. After you’ve determined activities, estimates, durations, dependencies, and resources, you use the schedule model in combination with your project management software to create the schedule.\\n\\nSchedule Development Process Outputs\\n\\nThe Schedule Development process has eight outputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject schedule\\n\\nSchedule model data\\n\\nSchedule baseline\\n\\nResource requirement updates\\n\\nActivity attributes updates\\n\\nProject calendar updates\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nProject management plan updates (updates to the schedule management plan)\\n\\nWe’ll take a look at the first three outputs of this process. We’ve covered all the other outputs previously. Take note that the two primary outputs from this process that will carry forward throughout the rest of the project are the project schedule and the schedule baseline.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 276  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n276\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nProject Schedule\\n\\nThe purpose of the Schedule Development process is to determine the start and finish dates for each of the project activities. One of the primary outputs of this process is the project schedule, which details this information as well as the resource assignments. However, depending on the size and complexity of your project or your organization’s culture, the resource assignments and start and finish dates may not be completed yet. If that’s the case, the project schedule is con- sidered preliminary until the resources are assigned to the activities.\\n\\nIn A Guide to the PMBOK terms, the project schedule is considered preliminary until resources are assigned. In reality, beware that once you’ve published the project schedule (even though it’s in a preliminary state), some stakeholders may regard this as the actual schedule and expect you to manage to the dates shown. Use caution when publishing schedules in their preliminary form.\\n\\nThe project schedule should be approved and signed off by stakeholders and functional man-\\n\\nagers. This assures you that they have read the schedule, understand the dates and resource commitments, and will likely cooperate. You’ll also need to obtain confirmation that resources will be available as outlined in the schedule when you’re working in a functional organization. The schedule cannot be finalized until you receive approval and commitment for the resource assignments outlined in it.\\n\\nOnce the schedule is approved, it will become your baseline for the remainder of the project. Project progress and task completion will be monitored and tracked against the project schedule to determine if the project is on course as planned.\\n\\nThe schedule can be displayed in a variety of ways, some of which are variations on what you’ve already seen. Project schedule network diagrams, like the ones discussed in Chapter 6, will work as schedule diagrams when you add the start and finish dates to each activity. These diagrams usually show the activity dependencies and critical path. Figure 7.2 shows a sample portion of a project schedule network diagram highlighting the programming activities.\\n\\nGantt charts are easy to read and commonly used to display schedule activities. Depending on the software you’re using to produce the Gantt chart, it might also show activity sequences, activity start and end dates, resource assignments, activity dependencies, and the critical path. Figure 7.3 is a simple example that plots various activities against time. These activities do not relate to the activities in the tables or other figures shown so far. Gantt charts are also known as bar charts.\\n\\nMilestone charts are another way to depict schedule information. Milestones mark the com- pletion of major deliverables or some other key event in the project. For example, approval and sign-off on project deliverables might be considered a milestone. Other examples might be com- pletion of a prototype, system testing, contract approval, and so on.\\n\\nMilestone charts might show the key events and their start or completion dates in a bar chart form similar to a Gantt chart. Or they can be written in a simple table format with milestones listed in the rows and expected schedule dates in one column and actual completion dates in another, as in the following example. As the milestones are met, the Actual Date column is filled in. This information can be included with the project status reports.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 277  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Schedule\\n\\n277\\n\\nF I G U R E 7 . 2\\n\\nProject schedule network diagram with activity dates\\n\\n4/13\\n\\n4/14\\n\\nHardware\\n\\n4/15\\n\\n4/22\\n\\nTest Hardware\\n\\n4/1\\n\\n4/12\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\n4/13\\n\\n4/22\\n\\nSoftware\\n\\n6/29\\n\\n7/6\\n\\nInstall\\n\\n7/7\\n\\n7/9\\n\\nTraining\\n\\n7/10\\n\\n7/10\\n\\nAcceptance\\n\\n6/6\\n\\n4/23\\n\\nWrite Code\\n\\n6/7\\n\\n6/28\\n\\nTest & Debug\\n\\nF I G U R E 7 . 3\\n\\nGantt chart\\n\\nAct #\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\nApril\\n\\nMay\\n\\nJune\\n\\nJuly\\n\\nMilestone\\n\\nScheduled Date\\n\\nActual Date\\n\\nSign\\n\\n\\n\\noff on deliverables\\n\\nSign\\n\\n\\n\\noff on hardware test\\n\\nProgramming completed\\n\\nTesting completed\\n\\nAcceptance and sign\\n\\n\\n\\noff\\n\\nProject closeout\\n\\n4/12\\n\\n4/22\\n\\n6/06\\n\\n6/28\\n\\n7/10\\n\\n7/10\\n\\n4/12\\n\\n4/25\\n\\n3601.book  Page 278  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n278\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nSchedule Model Data\\n\\nThe schedule model data refers to documenting the supporting data for the schedule. The min- imum amount of information in this output includes the milestones, schedule activities and activity attributes, and documenting the assumptions and constraints regarding the schedule. Other information that should be documented but doesn’t necessarily fit into the other catego- ries would get documented here. Always err on the side of too much documentation rather than not enough.\\n\\nYou will have to be the judge of what other information to include here, as it will depend on the nature of the project. A Guide to the PMBOK suggests that you might include resource his- tograms. There is an example resource histogram in Chapter 6 if you need to review. Resource histograms typically display hours needed on one axis and period of time (days, weeks, months, years) on the other axis. You might also include alternative schedules or contingency schedule reserves in this section.\\n\\nSchedule Baseline\\n\\nI think of the schedule baseline as the final, approved version of the project schedule with base- line start and baseline finish dates and resource assignments. A Guide to the PMBOK notes that you derive this baseline from a schedule network analysis of the schedule model.\\n\\nAs I’ve noted during discussions of some of the other Planning processes, project planning and project management are an iterative process. Rarely is anything cast in cement. You will continue to revisit processes throughout the project to refine and adjust. Eventually, processes do get put to bed. You wouldn’t want to come back to the Planning process at the conclusion of the project, for example, but keep in mind that the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring and Controlling process groups are iterative, and it’s not unusual to have to revise processes within these process groups as you progress on the project.\\n\\nIn practice for small to medium-sized projects, Activity Definition, Activity Sequencing, Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration Estimating, and Schedule Development are easily completed at the same time with the aid of good project management software. Gantt charts, critical path, resource allocation, activity dependencies, what-if analysis, and various reports are easily produced after plugging your scheduling information in to most project man- agement software tools. Regardless of your methods, be certain to obtain sign-off of the project schedule and provide your stakeholders and project sponsor with regular updates. And keep your schedule handy—there will likely be changes and modifications as you go. While you’re at it, make certain to save a schedule baseline for comparative purposes. Once you get into the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes you’ll be able to compare what you planned to do against what actually happened.\\n\\nNow we’re ready to prepare our last planning document, the project budget. First, we’ll look at some cost estimating techniques, and then we’ll plug those estimates into the project budget.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 279  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCost Estimating\\n\\n279\\n\\nCost Estimating\\n\\nYou now have an exhaustive breakdown of project activities, and you have some pretty good dura- tion estimates. Now the question that’s forever on the mind of the executive management staff: How much is it going to cost? The purpose of the Cost Estimating process is to answer that question. Every project has a budget, and part of completing a project successfully is completing it within the approved budget. Sometimes project managers are not responsible for the budget portion of the project. This function is assigned instead to a functional manager who is respon- sible for tracking and reporting all the project costs. I believe project mangers will have more and more responsibility in this area as the project management discipline evolves. Keep in mind that if you, as the project manager, don’t have responsibility for the project budget, your per- formance evaluation for the project should not include budget or cost measurements.\\n\\nBefore we dive into the Cost Estimating and Cost Budgeting process particulars, you should know that these processes are governed by a cost management plan that is created when you per- form the Project Management Plan process. Just like the schedule management plan, the cost man- agement plan isn’t developed during these processes and it isn’t an output of any of the Cost processes. There are a couple of things you should know about this plan for the exam. Like all the other management plans, it’s a subsidiary of the project management plan. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, some of the elements of this plan include, but aren’t limited to, the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPrecision levels, or the rounding you’ll use for project costs (hundreds, thousands, and so on)\\n\\nUnits of measure for resources such has hours for staff resources and hourly rates for con- tractor staff\\n\\nControl account links so that cost estimates for WBS elements can be linked directly to the accounting system\\n\\nVariance thresholds for costs\\n\\nEarned value rules (We’ll talk about this in the tools and techniques section.)\\n\\nReporting formats\\n\\nProcess descriptions\\n\\nAs with time estimates, the work breakdown structure (WBS) is the key to determining accu-\\n\\nrate cost estimates. The Cost Estimating process develops a cost estimate for the resources (human and material) required for each schedule activity. This includes weighing alternative options and examining trade-offs.\\n\\nLet’s look at an example. Many times software development projects take on a life of their own. The requested project completion dates are unrealistic; however, the project team commits to completing the project on time and on budget anyway. How do they do this? By cutting things like design, analysis, and documentation. In the end, the project might get completed on time and on budget, but was it really? The costs associated with the extended support period due to a lack of design and documentation and the hours needed by the software programmers to fix the reported bugs aren’t included in the original cost of the project (but they should have\\n\\n3601.book  Page 280  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n280\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nbeen). Therefore, the costs actually exceed what was budgeted. You should examine trade-offs such as these when determining cost estimates.\\n\\nWhen you are determining cost estimates, be certain to include all the costs of the project over its entire life cycle. As in the preceding example, software projects often have warranty periods that guarantee bug fixes or problem resolution within a certain time frame. This is a legitimate cost that should be included in your estimates.\\n\\nDon’t confuse pricing with Cost Estimating. If you are working for a company that performs consulting services on contract, for example, the price you will charge for your services is not the same thing as the costs to perform the project. The costs are centered on the resources needed to produce the product or service of the project. The price your company might charge for the service includes not only these costs, but a profit margin as well.\\n\\nCost Estimating Inputs\\n\\nYou are already familiar with all of the Cost Estimating inputs. They are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS dictionary\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan (including the schedule management plan, staffing management plan, and risk register)\\n\\nAs with several other processes we’ve covered, keep in mind organizational policies (such as cost estimating policies or templates), historical information, previous project files, constraints, and assumptions when deriving your cost estimates.\\n\\nCost Estimating Tools and Techniques\\n\\nCost Estimating has eight tools and techniques used to derive estimates:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nAnalogous estimating\\n\\nDetermine resource cost rates\\n\\nBottom\\n\\n\\n\\nup estimating\\n\\nParametric estimating\\n\\nProject management software\\n\\nVendor bid analysis\\n\\n3601.book  Page 281  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nCost Estimating\\n\\n281\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nReserve analysis\\n\\nCost of quality\\n\\nWe covered analogous, parametric estimating, and reserve analysis techniques in the Activity Duration Estimating section. All of the information talked about there applies here as well, except we’re using the tools and techniques to derive cost estimates. And, in the case of reserve anal- ysis, we’re adding cost reserves (or contingencies) during this process, not schedule reserves. You could aggregate these cost contingencies and assign them to a schedule activity or work package level. The Project management software is a tool that can help you establish project cost estimates and helps you quickly determine estimates given different variables and alternatives. We talked about cost of quality way back in Chapter 4. We’ll look at the remaining techniques next.\\n\\nDetermine Resource Rates\\n\\nResource rates are determined a number of ways. Your organization may have a vendor list with published rates that you’ll use. These are usually updated once or twice a year. You could request quotes from vendors or do some Internet searching to find rates. Don’t forget to include the resource rates of the folks who work within the organization as well. These rates apply to both human resources and materials.\\n\\nBottom\\n\\n\\n\\nUp Estimating\\n\\nWe discussed this technique in the Activity Resource Estimating process. This technique esti- mates costs associated with every activity individually and then rolls them up to derive a total project estimate. You wouldn’t choose this technique to provide a cost estimate for the project during Initiating if one were requested because you don’t have enough information at that stage to use the bottom-up technique. Instead, use the top-down estimation technique (analogous estimating) when a project cost estimate is needed early on in the project selection stage.\\n\\nVendor Bid Analysis\\n\\nAs the name implies, this is a process of gathering information from vendors to help you estab- lish cost estimates. You can accomplish this by requesting bids or quotes or working with some of your trusted vendor sources for estimates. You should compare vendor bids when using this tool and technique and not rely solely on one vendor to provide you with estimates.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, make sure you’re familiar with all the cost estimating tools and techniques, their benefits, and under what conditions you use them.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 282  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n282\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nCost Estimating Process Outputs\\n\\nObviously, one of the outputs of the Cost Estimating process is the activity cost estimates. These are quantitative amounts—usually stated in monetary units—that reflect the cost of the resources needed to complete the project activities. The tools and techniques we just described help you derive these estimates. Resources in this case include human resources, material, equipment, information technology needs, and so on as well as any contingency reserve amounts and inflation factors (if you’re using them).\\n\\nActivity Cost Estimating supporting detail, requested changes, and cost management plan updates are the remaining Cost Estimating outputs. Supporting detail is just as you’ve seen in other processes. Any information that supports how the estimates were developed, what assumptions were made during the Cost Estimating process, and any other details you think need to be documented go here. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the supporting detail should include the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nA description of the work that was estimated.\\n\\nA description of how the estimate was developed or the basis for the estimate.\\n\\nA description of the assumptions made about the estimates or the method used to deter- mine them.\\n\\nA description of the constraints.\\n\\nA range of possible results. Like the time estimates, the cost estimates should be stated within ranges such as “$500 ± $75.”\\n\\nCost variances will occur and estimates will be refined as you get further into your project. As\\n\\na result, you’ll update cost estimates and ultimately the project budget to reflect these changes.\\n\\nCost Estimating uses several techniques to make an accurate assessment of the project costs. In practice, using a combination of techniques is your best bet to come up with the most reliable cost estimates. The activity cost estimates will become an input to the Cost Budgeting process, which allows you to establish a baseline for project costs to track against.\\n\\nEstablishing the Cost Budget Baseline\\n\\nOur next process concerns determining the cost baseline, which is the primary output of the Cost Budgeting process. The Cost Budgeting process aggregates the cost estimates of activities and establishes a cost baseline for the project that is used to measure performance of the project throughout the remaining process groups. Only the costs associated with the project become part of the project budget. For example, future period operating costs are not project costs and therefore aren’t included in the project budget.\\n\\nThe cost baseline is the expected cost for the project. Remember that costs are tied to the\\n\\nfinancial system through the chart of accounts—or code of accounts—and are assigned to project activities at the work package level of the WBS.\\n\\nThe budget will be used as a plan for allocating costs to project activities.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 283  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nEstablishing the Cost Budget Baseline\\n\\n283\\n\\nCost Budgeting Inputs\\n\\nThe Schedule Development and Cost Estimating processes must be completed prior to working on Cost Budgeting because some of their outputs become the inputs to this process. The inputs for Cost Budgeting are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\n(cid:2) Work breakdown structure\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS dictionary\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nActivity cost estimates\\n\\nActivity cost estimate supporting detail\\n\\nProject schedule\\n\\nResource calendars\\n\\nContract\\n\\nCost management plan\\n\\nWe’ve covered all these inputs before. As usual, don’t forget to look at project constraints,\\n\\nparticularly funding limitations in this case.\\n\\nCost Budgeting Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThere are four tools and techniques in the Cost Budgeting process, including two that we haven’t seen before:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCost aggregation\\n\\nReserve analysis\\n\\nParametric estimating\\n\\nFunding limit reconciliation\\n\\nReserve analysis and parametric estimating have been covered previously. Note that reserve\\n\\nanalysis in this process also takes into consideration management contingency reserves for unplanned changes to project scope and project costs.\\n\\nCost aggregation Cost aggregation is the process of tallying the schedule activity cost esti- mates at the work package level and then totaling the work package levels to higher-level WBS component levels (such as the control accounts).\\n\\nFunding limit reconciliation Funding limit reconciliation involves reconciling the amount of funds spent with the amount of funds budgeted for the project. These limits are set by the orga- nization or by the customer. Reconciling the project expenses will require adjusting the schedule so that the expenses can be smoothed. This is done by placing imposed date constraints (we talked about these in the Schedule Development process) on work packages or other WBS com- ponents in the project schedule.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 284  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n284\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nCost Budgeting Process Outputs\\n\\nThe goal of Cost Budgeting is to develop a cost baseline (an output of this process) for the project that you can use in the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes to measure performance. We now have all of the information we need to create the cost baseline. In addi- tion, we’ll establish the project funding requirements.\\n\\nThe following are all of the outputs of the Cost Budgeting process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCost baseline\\n\\nProject funding requirements\\n\\nCost management plan updates\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nThe cost management plan updates and requested changes outputs have been covered pre-\\n\\nviously. We’ll look at the cost baseline in the following sections.\\n\\nDocumenting the Cost Baseline\\n\\nThe cost baseline, the first output of Cost Budgeting, is developed by adding up the costs of the WBS elements (remember, these costs were aggregated with the cost aggregation tool and tech- nique) according to time periods. Most projects span some length of time and most organiza- tions time the funding with the project. In other words, you won’t get all the funds for the project at the beginning of the project; they’ll likely be disbursed over time. The cost baseline provides the basis for measurement, over time, of the expected cash flows (or funding disburse- ments) against the requirements.\\n\\nCost baselines can be displayed graphically, with time increments on one axis and dollars expended on the other axis, as shown in Figure 7.4. The costs shown on this graph are cumu- lative costs, meaning that what you spent this period is added to what was spent last period and then charted. Many variations of this graph exist showing dollars budgeted against dollars expended to date and so on. Cost budgets can be displayed using this type of graph as well, by plotting the sum of the estimated costs excepted per period.\\n\\nF I G U R E 7 . 4\\n\\nCost baseline\\n\\nDollars\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\nActual\\n\\nCost\\n\\nBudgeted\\n\\nCost\\n\\nApril\\n\\nMay\\n\\nJune\\n\\nJuly\\n\\n3601.book  Page 285  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nEstablishing the Cost Budget Baseline\\n\\n285\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, remember that cost baselines are displayed as an S curve. The reason for this is that project spending starts out slowly, gradually increases over the project’s life until it reaches a peak, and then tapers off again as the project wraps up. Large projects are difficult to graph in this manner because the timescale isn’t wide enough to accurately show fluctua- tions in spending. There are other methods that more accurately graph costs that we’ll look at in the Cost Control process.\\n\\nThe cost baseline should contain the costs for all of the expected work on the project. You\\n\\nwould have identified most of these costs in the Cost Estimating process. You’ll find most projects’ largest expense is resource costs (as in labor costs). In the case of projects where you’re purchasing the final product, the purchase price is the largest cost.\\n\\nSchedule Development might have uncovered additional activities that need to be added to\\n\\nthe budget as well, so don’t forget to add them to your budget.\\n\\nLarge projects may have more than one cost baseline. For example, you may be required to track human resource costs, material costs, and contractor costs separately.\\n\\nThe cost baseline should also contain appropriations for risk response. We covered several categories and tools of Risk Response Planning in Chapter 5, “Risk Planning,” including avoid- ance, mitigation, insurance, and contingency plans. Some of the budget should be allocated to each of the techniques that you identified in your risk management plan. Additionally, you’ll want to set aside money for contingency reserves. This is for the unforeseen, unplanned risks that may occur. Even with all of the time and effort you spend on planning, unexpected things do crop up. Better to have the money set aside and not need it than to need it and not have it. We’ll revisit the cost baseline when we talk about the Cost Control process and examine dif-\\n\\nferent ways to measure costs.\\n\\nProject Funding Requirements\\n\\nProject funding requirements (which are also known as the project budget) are the total amount of money spent on the project. They are determined from the cost baseline and may include a manage- ment contingency reserve that’s used to manage cost overruns, particularly early on in the project. As I said earlier, spending usually starts out slowly on the project and picks up speed as you progress. Sometimes, the expected cash flows don’t match the pace of spending. Project funding requirements accounts for this by using a management reserve contingency (usually a margin or percentage of the cost baseline) that’s released in increments with the project budget. Figure 7.5 shows the cost base- line, the funding requirements, and the expected cash flows plotted on the S curve. This example shows a negative amount of management reserve because the difference between the funding requirements and the cost baseline at the end of project is the management reserve.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 286  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n286\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nF I G U R E 7 . 5\\n\\nCost baseline, funding requirements, and cash flow\\n\\ns\\n\\nr\\n\\na\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\no\\n\\nD\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\nCost Baseline\\n\\nExpected Cash Flow\\n\\nFunding\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nApril\\n\\nMay\\n\\nJune\\n\\nJuly\\n\\nBringing It All Together\\n\\nBelieve it or not, we have officially completed the Planning process group. Along the way, I’ve mentioned gaining approvals for portions of the project plan like the schedule and budget.\\n\\nThe project plan is the approved, formal, documented plan that’s used to guide you through- out the project Executing process group. The plan is made up of all the outputs of the Planning process groups, including the Project Management Plan. It’s the map that tells you where you’re going and how to perform the activities of the project plan during the Project Plan Execution process. It serves several purposes, the most important of which is tracking and measuring project performance through the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes and making future project decisions. The project plan is critical in all communications you’ll have from here forward with the stakeholders, management, and customers. The project plan also documents all project planning assumptions, all project planning decisions, and important man- agement reviews needed.\\n\\nThe project plan encompasses everything we’ve talked about up to now and is represented in a formal document, or collection of documents. This document contains the project scope statement, deliverables, assumptions, risks, WBS, milestones, project schedule, resources, and more. It becomes the baseline you’ll use to measure and track progress against. It’s also used to help you control the components that tend to stray from the original plan so you can get them back in line.\\n\\nThe project plan is used as a communication and information tool for stakeholders, team\\n\\nmembers, and the management team. They will use the project plan to review and gauge progress as well.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 287  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nBringing It All Together\\n\\n287\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nPerformance measurement baselines are management controls that should change only infre- quently. Examples of the performance measurement baselines we’ve looked at so far are Cost Budgeting baselines and schedule baselines. However, the project plan itself also becomes a baseline. If changes in scope or schedule do occur after Planning is complete, there’s a formal- ized process that you should go through to implement the changes, which we’ll cover in a Chapter 10, “Monitoring and Controlling Change.”\\n\\nDon’t forget that sign-off is an important part of this process. Your last step in the Planning process group is obtaining sign-off of the project plan from stakeholders, the sponsor, and the management team. If they’ve been an integral part of the Planning processes all along (and I know you know how important this is), obtaining sign-off of the project plan should simply be a formality.\\n\\nThe important thing to note here is that all the management plans we discussed during the Planning processes—the project management plan and its subsidiary plans, including the scope management plan, the schedule management plan and so on, plus the cost budgeting baseline and the schedule baseline—are used throughout the Executing process group to manage the project and keep the performance of the project on track with the project objectives. If you don’t have a project plan, you’ll have no way of managing the process. You’ll find that even with a project plan, project scope has a way of changing. Stakeholders and others tend to sneak in a few of the “Oh, I didn’t understand that before” statements and hope that they slide right by you. With that signed, approved project plan in your files, you are allowed to gently remind them that they read and agreed to the project plan and you’re sticking to it.\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nThe stakeholders provided you with an activity list the last time you met. After creating a com- plete activity list and the first draft of the project schedule network diagram, you went back to each of them to ask for time and cost estimates for each of the activities. Ricardo’s estimates are shown below with the activities he gave you last time:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nProcure the T1 connection. This takes 30 to 45 days and will have ongoing costs of $300 per month. This can be done concurrently with the other activities listed here. Ricardo will han- dle this activity.\\n\\n2. Run Ethernet cable throughout the building. This activity depends on the lease being\\n\\nsigned and must ﬁnish before the build-out can start. The estimated time to complete is 16 hours, which was ﬁgured using parametric estimating techniques. Ricardo has one person on staff who can complete this specialized activity. His ﬁrst available date is October 5.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 288  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n288\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5.\\n\\n6.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nPurchase the router, switch, server, and rack for the equipment room and four point-of- service terminals. The estimated costs are $17,000. Delivery time is two weeks. Ricardo will do this activity.\\n\\nInstall the router and test the connection. Testing depends on the T1 installation at demar- cation. The time estimate to install is eight hours. Ricardo’s staff will do this activity.\\n\\nInstall the switch. Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is two hours. Ricardo’s staff will do this activity.\\n\\nInstall the server and test. The testing depends on the T1 connection installation. Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is six hours. Ricardo’s staff will do this activity.\\n\\nThe web team will add the new store location and phone number to the lookup function on the Internet site. The time estimate is eight hours. Ricardo will assign his applications- programming manager to this activity. This activity depends on the lease being signed.\\n\\nJake and Jill have each written similar lists with estimates and resource assignments. You begin to align all the activities in sequential order and discover a problem. Jill needs 14 days to hire personnel and stock shelves, meaning that the build-out must be finished by January 16. Build-out takes approximately 120 days and can’t start before September 20 due to the con- tractor’s availability. This is a problem because Ricardo’s Ethernet cable expert isn’t available until October 5, and he needs 2 days to complete the cabling. This pushes out the build-out start date by almost 2 weeks, which means the project completion date, or store-opening date, is delayed by 2 weeks.\\n\\nAfter gathering more information from Ricardo, you head to Dirk’s office.\\n\\n“So, Dirk,” you conclude after filling him in on all the details, “We have two options. Hire a con- tractor to perform the cable run since Ricardo’s person isn’t available, or push the store open- ing out by two weeks.”\\n\\nDirk asks, “How much will the contractor charge to run the cable, and are they available within the time frame you need?”\\n\\n“Yes, they are available, and I’ve already requested Ricardo book the week of September 18 to hold this option open for us. They’ve quoted a price of $10,000.”\\n\\n“Okay, let’s bring in the contractor. At this point, $10,000 isn’t going to break the budget. How is that planning coming anyway? Signed a lease yet?”\\n\\n“Yes, we’ve signed the lease. Jake has been meeting with Gomez construction on the build-out. We’ve used Gomez on three out of the last five new stores and have had good luck with them.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 289  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nBringing It All Together\\n\\n289\\n\\nYou spend the next couple of days working on the project schedule in Microsoft Project, clari- fying tasks and activities with Jake, Ricardo, and Jill. You decide that a Gantt chart will work excellently for reporting status for this project. A portion of your first draft of the Gantt chart shows the following at the end of the project:\\n\\n3601.book  Page 290  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n290\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nYou stare intensely at the problem you see on the screen. The Grand Opening task (number 18) is scheduled to occur 13 days later than when you need it! Grand opening must happen February 1 and 2, not February 14 and 15 as the schedule shows. You trace the problem back and see that Grand Opening depends on Train Store Personnel, which itself depends on several other tasks, including Hire Store Personnel and Install and Test Hardware. Digging deeper, build-out can’t begin until the Ethernet cable is run throughout the building. Ricardo already set up the time with the contractor to run the cable September 18. This date cannot move, which means build-out can- not start any sooner than September 20, which works with Gomez’s availability.\\n\\nYou pick up the phone and dial Jake’s number. “Jake,” you say into the receiver, “I’m working on the project schedule, and I have some issues with the Gomez activity.”\\n\\n“Shoot,” Jake says.\\n\\n“Gomez Construction can’t start work until the Ethernet cable is run. I’ve already confirmed with Ricardo that there is no negotiation on this. Ricardo is hiring a contractor for this activity, and the earliest they can start is September 18. It takes them two days to run the cable, which puts the start date for build-out at September 20.”\\n\\n“What’s the problem with the September 20th date?” Jake asks.\\n\\n“Jill wants to have the build-out finished prior to hiring the store personnel. During the last store opening, those activities overlapped, and she said it was unmanageable. She wants to hire folks and have them stock the shelves in preparation for store opening but doesn’t want contractors in there while they’re doing it. A September 20 start date for Gomez puts us at a fin- ish date of January 26, which is too late to give Jill time to hire and stock shelves. My question is this, is 120 days to finish a build-out a firm estimate?”\\n\\n“Always—I’ve got this down to a science. Gomez has worked with me on enough of these build-outs that we can come within just a couple of days of this estimate either way,” Jake says.\\n\\nYou pick up your schedule detail and continue, “I’ve scheduled Gomez’s resource calendar as you told me originally. Gomez doesn’t work Sundays and neither do we. Their holidays are Labor Day, a couple of days at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s, but this puts us too far out on the schedule. We must have our February 1 opening coincide with the Garden and Home Show dates.”\\n\\n“I can’t change the 120 days. Sounds like you have a problem.”\\n\\n“I need to crash the schedule,” you say. “What would the chances be of Gomez agreeing to split the build-out tasks? We could hire a second contractor to come in and work alongside Gomez’s crew to speed up this task. That would shorten the duration to 100 days, which means we could meet the February 1 date.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 291  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nBringing It All Together\\n\\n291\\n\\n“Won’t happen. I know Gomez. They’re a big outfit and have all their own crews. We typically work with them exclusively. If I brought another contractor into the picture, I might have a hard time negotiating any kind of favors with them later if we get into a bind.”\\n\\n“All right,” you say. “How about this? I’m making some changes to the resource calendar while we’re talking. What if we authorize Gomez’s crew to work six 10-hour days, which still leaves them with Sundays off, and we ask them to work Labor Day and take only one day at Thanks- giving instead of two?”\\n\\nThe detail showing these changes is as follows:\\n\\n3601.book  Page 292  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n292\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\n“I think Gomez would go for that. You realize it’s going to cost you?”\\n\\n“Project management is all about trade-offs. We can’t move the start date, so chances are the budget might take a hit to accommodate schedule changes or risk. Fortunately, I’m just now wrapping up the final funding requirements, or the cost budget, so if you can get me the increased cost from Gomez soon, I’d appreciate it. This change will keep us on track and resolve Jill’s issues too.”\\n\\n“I don’t think Gomez’s crew will mind the overtime during the holiday season. Everyone can use a little extra cash at that time of year, it seems. I’ll have the figures for you in a day or two.”\\n\\nProject Case Study Checklist\\n\\nActivity Duration Estimating\\n\\nActivity Resource Estimating\\n\\nDeveloping project schedule\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCalendars\\n\\nLead and lag time\\n\\nCritical path\\n\\nDuration compression\\n\\nCrashing\\n\\nUtilizing project management software\\n\\nProducing project schedule\\n\\n(cid:2) Milestones\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nGantt chart\\n\\nResource leveling\\n\\nCost estimates\\n\\nCost baseline\\n\\nFinalized project plan\\n\\n3601.book  Page 293  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n293\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nGreat job, you’ve made it through the entire Planning process group. We covered several pro- cesses in this chapter, including Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration Estimating, Schedule Development, Cost Estimating, and Cost Budgeting.\\n\\nThe Activity Resource Estimating process considers all the resources needed and the quantity of resources needed to perform project activities. This information is determined for each sched- ule activity and is documented in the activity resource requirements output.\\n\\nDuration estimates are produced as a result of the Activity Duration Estimating process. Activity duration estimates document the number of work periods needed for each activity, including their elapsed time. Analogous estimating—also called top-down estimating—is one way to determine activity duration estimates. Top-down techniques can also be used to estimate project durations and total project costs. Parametric estimating techniques multiply a known element—like the quantity of materials needed—by the time it takes to install or complete one unit of materials. The result is a total estimate for the activity. Three-point estimates average the most likely estimate, a pessimistic estimate, and an optimistic estimate. Reserve analysis takes schedule risk into consideration by adding an additional percentage of time or another work period to the estimate just in case you run into trouble.\\n\\nSchedule Development is the process in which you assign beginning and ending dates to activities and determine their duration. You might use CPM to accomplish this. CPM calculates early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates. It also determines float time. All tasks with zero float are critical path tasks. The critical path is usually the longest path in the project. PERT calculates a weighted average estimate for each activity by using the optimistic, pes- simistic, and most likely times and then determines variances, or standard deviations, to come up with a total project duration within a given confidence range. Work will finish within plus or minus one standard deviation 68.26 percent of the time. Work will finish within plus or minus two standard deviations 95.44 percent of the time.\\n\\nSchedules sometimes need to be compressed to meet promised dates or to shorten the sched- ule times. Crashing looks at cost and schedule trade-offs. Adding resources to critical path tasks and limiting or reducing the project requirements or scope are ways to crash the schedule. Fast tracking involves beginning at the same time two tasks that were originally scheduled to start one after the other. Fast tracking increases project risk.\\n\\nMonte Carlo analysis can be used in the Schedule Development process to determine multi-\\n\\nple, probable project durations.\\n\\nResource leveling attempts to smooth out the schedule and properly allocate resources to\\n\\ncritical path tasks. This may require updates to the resource management plan.\\n\\nThe project schedule details the activities in graphical form through the use of project sched- ule network diagrams with dates, Gantt charts, milestone charts, or project schedule network diagrams.\\n\\nThe Cost Estimating process determines how much the project resources will cost and these costs are usually stated in monetary amounts. Analogous estimating is one technique that can be used to determine cost estimates. Another technique is parametric estimating. Bottom-up\\n\\n3601.book  Page 294  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n294\\n\\nChapter 7 (cid:2) Creating the Project Schedule and Budget\\n\\nestimating can be used for project cost estimates. This involves estimating the cost of each schedule activity and then rolling these up to come up with a total work package cost.\\n\\nThe Cost Budgeting baseline will be used throughout the project to measure project expendi- tures, variance, and project performance. The cost baseline is graphically displayed as an S curve.\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to name the purpose of the Activity Resource Estimating process. The purpose of Activity Resource Estimating is to determine the types of resources needed (human, equipment, and materials) and in what quantities for each schedule activity within a work package.\\n\\nBe able to name the tools and techniques of Activity Duration Estimating. The tools and techniques of Activity Duration Estimating are expert judgment, analogous estimating, para- metric estimating, three-point estimates, and reserve analysis.\\n\\nBe able to define the difference between analogous estimating and bottom-up estimating. Analogous estimating is a top-down technique that uses expert judgment and historical informa- tion. Bottom-up estimating performs estimates for each work item and rolls them up to a total.\\n\\nBe able to calculate the critical path. The critical path includes the activities whose durations add up to the longest full path of the project schedule network diagram. Critical path is calcu- lated using the forward pass, backward pass, and float calculations.\\n\\nBe able to define a critical path task. A critical path task is a project activity with zero float.\\n\\nBe able to describe and calculate PERT duration estimates. This is a weighted average tech- nique that uses three estimates: optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. The formula is as fol- lows: (optimistic + pessimistic + (4 × most likely)) ÷ 6.\\n\\nBe able to name the duration compression techniques. The duration compression techniques are crashing and fast tracking.\\n\\nBe able to identify and describe the primary output of the Cost Estimating process. The pri- mary output of Cost Estimating is activity cost estimates. These estimates are quantitative amounts—usually stated in monetary units—that reflect the cost of the resources needed to complete the project activities.\\n\\nBe able to describe the cost baseline. The cost baseline is the expected cost of the project and is used to measure performance. It’s displayed as an S curve.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 295  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\n295\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

Analogous—or top-down—estimating techniques are a form of expert judgment. Since\\n\\nthis project is similar to another recent project, you can use the cost estimates from the previous project to help you quickly determine estimates for the current project.\\n\\n3. C. Reserve analysis takes schedule risk into consideration and adds a percentage of time or addi-\\n\\ntional work periods to the estimate to prevent schedule delays.\\n\\n4. C. Parametric estimating multiplies a known element—like the quantity of materials needed— by the time it takes to install or complete one unit of materials. The result is a total estimate for the activity. In this case, 10 servers multiplied by 16 hours per server gives you a 160-hour total duration estimate.\\n\\n5. B. Bottom-up techniques are the most time-consuming and the most accurate estimates you can use.\\n\\nWith bottom-up estimating, each work item is estimated and rolled up to a project total.\\n\\n6. A. The project schedule determines the start and ending dates of activities, determines float times,\\n\\ngenerally shows resource assignments, and details the activity sequences and durations.\\n\\n7. C. The CPM calculates a single early and late start date and a single early and late finish date for each activity. Once these dates are known, float time is calculated for each activity to determine the critical path. The other answers contain elements of PERT calculations.\\n\\n8. B. The only information you have for this example is activity duration, therefore the critical path is the path with the longest duration. Path A-D-E-H with a duration of 34 days is the critical path.\\n\\n9. D. The only information you have for this example is activity duration, so you must calculate the critical path based on the durations given. The duration of A-B-C-E-H increased by 3 days for a total of 35 days. The duration of A-F-G-H and A-F-G-E-H each increased by 3 days. A-F-G- E-H totals 36 days and becomes the new critical path.\\n\\n10. D. The critical path is calculated by adding together the durations of all the tasks with zero float.\\n\\nThe critical path can be compressed using crashing techniques.\\n\\n11. C. The calculation for PERT is the sum of optimistic time plus pessimistic time plus four times\\n\\nthe most likely time divided by 6. The calculation for this example is as follows: (48 + 72 + (4 × 60)) ÷ 6 = 60.\\n\\n12. D. The standard deviation is calculated by subtracting the optimistic time from the pessimistic\\n\\ntime and dividing the result by 6. The calculation for this example is as follows: (72 – 48) ÷ 6 = 4.\\n\\n13. D. There is a 95 percent probability that the work will finish within plus or minus two standard deviations. The expected value is 500, and the standard deviation times 2 is 24, so the activity will take from 476 to 524 days.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 303  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nAnswers to Review Questions\\n\\n303\\n\\n14. B. A 68 percent probability is calculated using plus or minus one standard deviation, a 95 per- cent probability uses plus or minus two standard deviations, and a 99 percent probability uses plus or minus three standard deviations.\\n\\n15. A. Crashing the schedule includes things like adding resources to the critical path tasks or lim-\\n\\niting project requirements.\\n\\n16. C. Resource leveling attempts to smooth out resource assignments by splitting tasks, assigning underallocated team members to more tasks, or delaying the start of tasks to match team mem- bers’ availability.\\n\\n17. A. Project management software is a very useful tool for the project manager, and it automates project scheduling, allowing for what-if analysis and easy changes. But if you focus too much on the tool and ignore the project, the tool becomes a hindrance.\\n\\n18. A. Stakeholders ordinarily will not have much say in the project Planning methodology used by the project manager. The methodology employed is usually determined by the organization, the project office, or the project manager.\\n\\n19. C. Future period operating costs are considered ongoing costs and are not part of project costs.\\n\\n20. B. The cost baseline is displayed as an S curve because of the way project spending occurs.\\n\\nSpending begins slowly, picks up speed until the spending peak is reached, and then tapers off as the project winds down.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 304  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n3601.book  Page 305  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nChapter\\n\\n8\\n\\nDeveloping the\\n\\nProject Team\\n\\nTHE PMP EXAM CONTENT FROM THE EXECUTING THE PROJECT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nExecute Tasks Defined in Project Plan\\n\\nEnsure Common Understanding and Set Expectations\\n\\nImplement the Procurement of Project Resources\\n\\nManage Resource Allocation\\n\\nImprove Team Performance\\n\\n3601.book  Page 306  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nThis chapter begins the project Executing process group. We’ll cover four of the processes in this chapter: Direct and Manage Project Execution, Acquire Project Team, Develop Project Team, and Distributing Information. We’ll jump around a bit in this chapter as you can tell from the processes we’ll cover. Many of these processes are extensions, so to speak, of the Planning pro- cesses leading up to them. We’ll cover the remaining Executing processes in the next chapter. Direct and Manage Project Execution is the action process. This is where you’ll put the plans into action and begin working on the project activities. Execution also involves keeping the project in line with the original project plan and bringing wayward activities back into alignment.\\n\\nSeveral things happen during the Executing processes. The majority of the project budget will be spent during this process group, and often the majority of the project time is expended here as well. The greatest conflicts you’ll see during the project Executing processes are schedule con- flicts. In addition, the product description will be finalized here and contain more detail than it did in the Planning processes.\\n\\nHang with me during this chapter, because there are several references to the next process— the Monitoring and Controlling process group—that are inputs to the Executing process group. These are the only two process groups that serve as inputs to each other. Since we can’t discuss both of them at the same time, we’ll tell you when there’s something specific from the Moni- toring and Controlling process group that will be discussed in a later chapter.\\n\\nThere might be several exam questions from every process within the Executing process group. You’ll find the majority of questions are about the Direct and Manage Project Execution, the Acquire Project Team, and Develop Project Team processes. Don’t skip studying the other processes, however, as roughly a quarter of the exam questions concern the entire Executing process group. Are you ready to dive into Executing? Let’s go.\\n\\nExecuting the Project Plan\\n\\nDirect and Manage Project Execution\\n\\nThe purpose of the plan. This is where your project comes to life and the work of the project happens. The work is authorized to begin and activities are performed. Resources are committed and carry out their assigned activities to create the product or service of the project. Funds are spent to accomplish project objectives. Performing project activities, training, selecting sellers, collecting project data, utilizing resources, and so on are all integrated with or a part of this process.\\n\\nprocess is to carry out the project\\n\\nDirect and Manage Project Execution is where the rubber meets the road. If you’ve done a good job planning the project, things should go relatively smoothly for you during this process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 307  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nExecuting the Project Plan\\n\\n307\\n\\nThe deliverables and requirements are agreed to, the resources have been identified and are ready to go, and the stakeholders know exactly where you’re headed because you had them review, agree to, and approve the project plan.\\n\\nSome project managers think this is the time for them to kick back and put their feet up. After all, the project plan is done, everyone knows what to do and what’s expected of them, and the work of the project should almost carry itself out because your project plan is a work of genius, right? Wrong! You must stay involved. Your job now is a matter of overseeing the actual work, staying on top of issues and problems, and keeping the work lined up with the project plan.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe project plan serves as the project baseline. During the Executing processes, you should continually compare and monitor project performance against the baseline so that corrective actions can be taken and implemented at the right time to prevent disaster. This information will also be fed into the Monitoring and Controlling processes for further analysis.\\n\\nOne of the most difficult aspects of this process is coordinating and integrating all the ele- ments of the project. While you do have the project plan as your guide, there are still a lot of balls in the air. You’ll find yourself coordinating and monitoring many project elements—occa- sionally all at the same time—during the course of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process. You may be negotiating for team members at the same time you’re negotiating with vendors at the same time you’re working with another manager to get a project component completed so your deliverable stays on schedule. Risks and risk triggers should be monitored closely. The Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process may need intervention or cause you delays. The organizational, technical, and interpersonal interfaces may require intense coordi- nation and oversight. And of course, you should always be concerned about the pulse of your stakeholders. Are they actively involved in the project? Are they throwing up roadblocks now that the work has started?\\n\\nAccording to\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nthis process also requires implementing corrective actions\\n\\nto bring the work of the project back into alignment with the project plan, preventive actions to reduce the probability of negative consequences, and defect repairs to correct product defects dis- covered during the quality processes.\\n\\nAs you can see, your work as project manager is not done yet. There are many elements to\\n\\nthe project that require your attention, so let’s get to work.\\n\\nLater in this chapter we’ll also talk about Develop Project Team because this is an integral part of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process as well. You’ll want to monitor the team’s performance, the status of their work, and their interactions with you and other team members as you execute the project plan.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 308  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n308\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2)\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\nExecuting Inputs\\n\\nDirect and Manage Project Execution has seven inputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nApproved corrective actions\\n\\nApproved preventive actions\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\nApproved defect repair\\n\\nValidated defect repair\\n\\nAdministrative closure procedure\\n\\nThe project management plan documents the collection of outputs of the Planning processes\\n\\nand describes and defines how the project should be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed. We’ll take a brief look at each of the other inputs next.\\n\\nApproved Corrective Actions\\n\\nCorrective actions\\n\\nIn my organization, a corrective action means an employee has big trouble coming. Fortunately, are taken to get the anticipated future project this isn’t what’s meant here. outcomes to align with the project plan. Maybe you’ve discovered that one of your program- mers is adding an unplanned feature to the software project because he’s friends with the user. You’ll have to redirect him to the activities assigned to him originally to avoid schedule delays. Perhaps your vendor isn’t able to deliver the laboratory equipment needed for the next project phase. You’ll want to exercise your contract options (hopefully there’s a clause in the contract that says they must provide rental equipment until they can deliver your order), put your con- tingency plan into place, and get the lab the equipment that’s needed to keep the project on schedule.\\n\\nCorrective actions are outputs of processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group, but they serve as inputs to the Direct and Manage Project Exe- cution process. We’ll talk more about corrective actions in Chapter 10, “Moni- toring and Controlling Change.”\\n\\nApproved Preventive Action\\n\\ninvolves anything that will reduce the potential impacts of risk events should Preventive action they occur. Contingency plans and risk responses are examples of preventive action. These and other risk responses are described in the Risk Response Planning process discussed in Chapter 5, “Risk Planning.” You should be aware of contingency plans and risk responses so that you’re ready to implement them at the first sign of trouble. Approved preventive actions are an output of processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 309  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nExecuting the Project Plan\\n\\n309\\n\\nApproved Change Requests\\n\\nApproved change requests, another output of the Monitoring and Controlling process group, are changes that either expand or reduce project scope. Approved changes may also cause revi- sions to project budgets, schedules, procedures, project management plans, and so on. Change requests can be internal or external to the project or organization. For example, a new law that’s passed that affects your project may require changes.\\n\\nApproved Defect Repairs\\n\\nOkay, it’s your turn to figure it out: Defect repairs are an output of what process? Approved defect repairs authorize corrections to product defects that are discovered during the Perform Quality Assurance process (primarily during product inspection or during quality audits). Approved defect repairs are an output of the Integrated Change Control process.\\n\\nValidated Defect Repair\\n\\nThe difference between a validated defect repair and a defect repair is that the validated defect repair is the result of a reinspection of the original defect repair. In other words, you found a problem with the product during the Quality processes, you corrected the problem (defect repair), and now you’re reinspecting that repair (validated defect repair) to make certain the fix is accurate, correct, and fixed the problem.\\n\\nAdministrative Closure Procedure\\n\\nadministrative closure procedure\\n\\nThe is a document that outlines how administrative closure will occur on the project, the activities needed to perform this procedure, and the essential roles and responsibilities.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, remember that the outputs of the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling pro- cess groups are also inputs to each other.\\n\\nTools and Techniques of Direct and Manage Project Execution\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process are project man- agement methodology and project management information system. We’ve looked at both of these before. Remember that in the Executing processes, you’ll be actively using both of these tools (employing the methodology you’ve developed in Planning and referring to the PMIS to update and track progress).\\n\\n3601.book  Page 310  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n310\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2)\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nA curious thing happens here. While work authorization systems as a tool and technique of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process, it’s still listed in its glossary as a tool. That’s curious because it’s also part of the enterprise environmental factors input. Even though this isn’t listed in I recommend understanding A Guide to the PMBOK, what a work authorization system is for the exam and how you use it. And for the record, you’ll use these during the Executing processes.\\n\\nno longer lists\\n\\nWork authorization systems\\n\\nclarify and initiate the work of each work package or activity. This is a formal procedure that authorizes work to begin in the correct sequence and at the right time. Work authorization systems are usually written procedures defined by the organization. They might include e-mail, intranet-based, or paper-based systems. Verbal instructions may work well with small projects. Understand the complexity of the project and balance the cost of instituting a work authorization system against the benefit you’ll receive from it. This may be overkill on small projects, and as stated earlier, verbal instructions might work just as well. Work is usually authorized using a form that describes the task, the responsible party, antic- ipated start and end dates, special instructions, and whatever else is particular to the activity or project. Depending on the organizational structure, the work is assigned and authorized by either the project manager or the functional manager.\\n\\nSome of the outputs of this process are going to look familiar. Let’s examine them next.\\n\\nOutputs of Direct and Manage Project Execution\\n\\nMost of the outputs of the Planning process group, and some of the outputs of the Monitoring and Controlling process group, are utilized by the Direct and Manage Project Execution pro- cess. The outputs of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nImplemented change requests\\n\\nImplemented corrective actions\\n\\nImplemented preventive actions\\n\\nImplemented defect repairs\\n\\nWork performance information\\n\\nThe two primary outputs are deliverables, meaning actually accomplishing the activities leading to completion of the product or service you set out to produce, and work performance information. Without having completed the prior processes, you wouldn’t know what the work of the project should look like. The outputs starting with\\n\\nwere covered in the tools and techniques section. The only difference between the tools and techniques and the output is that during the output, the\\n\\nimplemented\\n\\n3601.book  Page 311  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nExecuting the Project Plan\\n\\n311\\n\\naction or request is implemented. Because I haven’t mentioned it in a while, now’s a good time for a documentation reminder—it’s not a bad idea to record all of the approved and imple- mented actions for future reference. Let’s take a look at the other three outputs.\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\nDuring Direct and Manage Project Execution, you’ll gather and record information regarding the outcomes of the work, including activity completion dates, milestone completions, the sta- tus of the deliverables, the quality of the deliverables, costs, schedule progress and updates, and so on. Deliverables aren’t always tangible. For example, perhaps your team members require training on a piece of specialized equipment. Completion of the training is recorded as a work result. Capabilities required to perform a service that’s described in the project management plan are also considered a deliverable. All of this information gets used during the Performance Reporting process, which we’ll discuss during the Monitoring and Controlling processes.\\n\\nExecuting and Monitoring and Controlling are two process groups that work hand in hand. As you gather the information from work results, you’ll measure the outputs and take corrective actions where necessary. This means you’ll loop back through the Executing processes to put breaks these processes up for ease of expla- the corrections into place. nation, but in practice, you’ll work through several of the Executing and Monitoring and Con- trolling processes together.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nRequested Changes\\n\\nAs a result of working through activities and producing your product or service, you will inev- itably come upon things that need to be changed. This might encompass schedule changes, scope changes, or requirements or resource changes. The list really could go on. Your job as project manager, if you choose to accept it, is to collect the change requests and make determi- nations about their impact to the project.\\n\\nWe’ll discuss change requests in the coming chapters. Requested changes are an output of\\n\\nseveral process, including the Direct and Manage Project Execution process and the Perfor- mance Reporting process in the Monitoring and Controlling process group. Remember that Executing and Monitoring and Controlling outputs feed each other as inputs.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nDirect and Manage Project Execution is where the work of the project is performed and the project plan is put into action and carried out. In this process, the project manager is like an orchestra conductor signaling the instruments to begin their activities, monitoring what should be winding down, and keeping that smile going to remind everyone that they should be enjoy- ing themselves. I recommend that you know the outputs of the Direct and Manage Project Exe- cution process for the exam.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 312  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n312\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2)\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\nWork Performance Information\\n\\nWork performance information concerns gathering, documenting, and recording the status of these are the types of information you project activities.

It’s important that you docu- ment this information so that when you get to the Monitoring and Controlling processes, you don’t have to backtrack.\\n\\nWe’re going to switch topics now. I told you the Executing process group is about perform- ing the work of the project, and in order to do that, we need resources. We’ll look at two pro- cesses, Acquire the Project Team and Develop the Project Team, in the next few sections.\\n\\nAcquiring the Project Team\\n\\nAcquire Project Team\\n\\nprocess involves attaining and assigning human resources to the\\n\\nThe project. Project staff may come from inside the company or from outside the company in the form of full-time employees hired specifically for the project or as contract help. In any case, it’s your job as the project manager to ensure that resources are available and skilled in the project activities they’re assigned to. However, in practice you may find that you don’t always have control over the selection of team members. Someone else, the big boss for example, may hand- pick the folks they want working on the project and it’s up to you to assess their skills and decide where they best fit on the project.\\n\\nThe Acquire Project Team process inputs are as follows: enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets, roles and responsibilities, project organization charts, and staff- ing management plan.\\n\\nSome project activities may require special skills or knowledge in order to be completed. The\\n\\nenterprise environmental factors input involves taking this information into account as well as considering personal interests, characteristics, and availability of potential team members before making assignments. For example, consider the previous experience of the staff member\\n\\n3601.book  Page 313  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nAcquiring the Project Team\\n\\n313\\n\\nyou’re thinking of assigning to a specific activity. Have they performed this function before? Do they have the experience necessary for the level of complexity this project activity calls for? Are they competent and proficient at these skills?\\n\\nPersonal interests and personal characteristics play a big role as well. If the person you’re thinking of just isn’t interested in the project, they aren’t likely to perform at their best. If you can, think about assigning someone else in a case like this. Unfortunately, some people just don’t play well with others. When you’re assigning staff, if at all possible, don’t put the only two people in the whole company who can’t get along together on the same project. If the staff member you need has a skill no one else has or they can perform a function like no one else can, you might not have a choice. In this case, you’ll have to employ other techniques to keep the team cohesive and working well together despite the not-so-friendly characteristics of the vital team member.\\n\\nOne final consideration: Check on the availability of key team members. If the team member\\n\\nyou must have for the activity scheduled in February is on their honeymoon, you probably aren’t going to win the toss.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nEven though the availability, experience levels, interests, cost, and abilities of your resources are considered part of the enterprise environmental factors input, you should understand these inputs and their importance to the Acquire Project Team process for the exam.\\n\\nRecruitment practices are an example of the organizational process assets to watch for in this process. This is a matter of making certain you consult any organizational procedures or poli- cies currently in place when hiring and assigning staff. Organizational policies that dictate recruitment practices are constraints.\\n\\nWe’ve looked at the other inputs in previous processes, so we’ll move on to the tools and\\n\\ntechniques of this process.\\n\\nTools and Techniques of Acquire Project Team\\n\\nPreassignment, negotiation, acquisitions, and virtual teams are tools and techniques of the Acquire Project Team process. As the project manager, you will use the negotiation technique a lot. You’ll have to negotiate with functional managers and other organizational department managers—and sometimes with the vendor to get some of their best people—for resources for your project and for the timing of those resources.\\n\\nPreassignment\\n\\ncan happen when the project is put out for bid and specific team members are\\n\\npromised as part of the proposal or when internal project team members are promised and assigned as a condition of the project. When staff members are promised as part of the project proposal—particularly on internal projects—they should be identified in the project charter.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 314  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n314\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2)\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\nAvailability is one part of the negotiating equation. You’ll have to work with the functional manager or other project managers to ensure that the staff member you’re requesting is avail- able when the schedule says they’re needed.\\n\\nThe second part of the equation is the competency level of the staff member they’re assigning to your project. I remember hearing someone say once that availability is not a skill set. Be wary of functional managers who are willing to offer up certain individuals “anytime” while others are “never available.” Be certain your negotiations include discussions about the skills and per- sonal characteristics of the team members you’re asking for.\\n\\nAcquisition is another tool and technique of the Acquire Project Team process. It involves hiring individuals or teams of people for certain project activities, either as full-time employees or as contract help during the course of the project or project phase or for specific project activ- ities. Procurement is usually required when the organization does not have employees with the required skills and competencies available to work on the project.\\n\\nChapter 6, “Resource Planning,” covers the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process in more detail.\\n\\nVirtual teams\\n\\nare teams that don’t necessarily work in the same location but all share the goals of the project and have a role on the project. This type of team allows you to include folks from different geographic locations, those who work different hours or shifts than the other team mem- “Virtual bers, those with mobility limitations, and so on. According to teams can be defined as groups of people with a shared goal, who fulfill their roles with little or no time spent meeting face to face.” In today’s wonderful world of technology, team members can use the Internet, e-mail, videoconferencing, and teleconferencing to meet and communicate on a regular basis. This of course brings to light the importance of communication. Make certain all team members are aware of the protocols for communicating in a virtual team environment, understand the expectations, and are clear regarding decision making processes. It’s vital in this type of team structure that you as the project manager give credit to the appropriate team mem- bers for their performance and actions on the project.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nOutputs of Acquire Project Team\\n\\nThe resulting outputs of the Acquire Project Team process are project staff assignment, resource availability, and staffing management plan updates.\\n\\nYour ability to influence the selection of resources (using the negotiating technique) will\\n\\nimpact the project staff assignment output. After determining elements like the roles and responsibilities, reviewing recruitment practices, and negotiating for staff, you assign project team members to project activities. Along with this output, a project team directory is published listing the names of all project team members and stakeholders. Don’t forget to also include team member names in project organization charts, RAM charts, and other planning docu- ments if their assignments or names weren’t known when you created those documents.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 315  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\n315\\n\\nThe Only Candidate\\n\\n“Hey, did you hear?” your friend Story asks. “Roger has been assigned to the project team.”\\n\\n“Over my dead body,” you reply, pushing away from your computer screen. You head straight for the project manager’s office and don’t wait for a response from Story.\\n\\nAnn seats the phone into the cradle just as you walk through the door. Fortunately for you, Ann’s door is always open and she welcomes drop-ins.\\n\\n“Seems like something is on your mind,” Ann says. “What can I help with?”\\n\\n“Story just told me that Roger has been assigned to the project team. I can’t work with Roger. He’s arrogant and doesn’t respect anyone’s work but his own. He belittles me in front of others, and I don’t deserve that. I write good code copy, and I don’t need Roger looking over my shoul- der. I want to be on this team, but not if Roger is part of it.”\\n\\nAnn thinks for a minute and replies, “I want you to have the opportunity to work on this project; it’s a great opportunity for you. But there isn’t anyone else who can work on the analysis phase of this project except Roger. He’s the only one left who has a solid understanding of the main- frame legacy code. Unfortunately, those old programs were never documented well, and they’ve evolved over the years into programs on top of programs. Without Roger’s knowledge of the existing system, we’d blow the budget and time estimates already established for this project. What would you say to a meeting with you and Roger and me to talk about these issues and see if we can’t work this out?”\\n\\nThe time periods your project staff are available are documented in the resource availability output. This document comes in handy when you’re creating the final schedule and assigning resources to activities.\\n\\nThe\\n\\nstaffing management plan\\n\\nmay require updates to document the project roles and\\n\\nresponsibilities of the staff assigned to the project. This document may require updates through- out the project if you have staff members leave due to promotion or, heaven forbid, if they leave for employment in another company (unless you want\\n\\nthem to leave—that’s another story). Now we have the team, what do we do with them? We’ll look at topics like motivation,\\n\\nrewards, and recognition in the next process, Develop Project Team.\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\nProjects exist to create a unique product or service within a limited time frame. Projects are per- formed by people, and most projects require more than one person to perform all of the activities.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 316  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n316\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nIf you’ve got more than one person working on your project, you’ve got a team. And if you’ve got a team, you’ve got a wide assortment of personalities, skills, needs, and issues in the mix. Couple this with part-time team members, teams based in functional organizations whose loyalty lies with the functional manager, or teams based in matrix organizations that report to you for project- related activities and another manager for their functional duties and you could have some real challenges on your hands. Good luck—okay, I won’t leave you hanging like that.\\n\\nThe Develop Project Team process is about creating an open, encouraging environment for your team and developing it into an effective, functioning, coordinated group. Projects are per- formed by individuals, and the better they work together, the smoother and the more efficient the execution of the project will be. I’m sure you all have had the experience of working with a team that pitched in and shared workloads when the work became unbalanced. I’m also sure you all have worked with teams that didn’t do this, teams whose members took on a “me first” attitude and could care less about the plight of their fellow team members. I’d much rather work with a team like the first example.\\n\\nProper development of the team is critical to a successful project. Since teams are made up of individuals, individual development becomes a critical factor to project success. Individual team members need the proper development and training to perform the activities of the project or to enhance their existing knowledge and skills. The development needed will depend on the project. Perhaps you have a team member who’s ready to make the jump into a lead role but they don’t have any experience at lead work. Give them some exposure by assigning them a lim- ited amount of activities in a lead capacity, provide them with some training if needed, and be available to coach and mentor where needed. The best option is to work with the management team to provide this person with the development they need prior to the start of the project (if you’re lucky enough to know that early on who your resources might be and what their existing skills are).\\n\\nDevelop Project Team inputs include project staff assignments, staffing management plan,\\n\\nand resource availability. Funny thing, these inputs are all outputs that we discussed in the Acquire Project Team process, so we’ll move on.\\n\\nTools and Techniques for Develop Project Team\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of Develop Project Team are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nGeneral management skills\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nTeam building activities\\n\\nGround rules\\n\\nCollocation\\n\\nRecognition and rewards\\n\\nWe’ll cover all these tools and techniques next.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 317  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\n317\\n\\nGeneral Management Skills\\n\\nYou learned about general management skills back in Chapter 1, “What Is a Project?” These include skills like general business knowledge, budgeting, organizational skills, problem solving skills, and so on. What’s important to note here is that the general management skills of lead- ership, influence negotiation, communications, empathy, and creativity are especially useful during this process and others in the Executing process group.\\n\\nOne other thing to consider regarding this tool and technique is that you’ll have resources from other departments who have assignments on the project that you’re responsible for over- seeing. For example, the finance department and the marketing department may have assigned project activities, and as the project manager, you’ll manage their progress. This implies that you’ll need general knowledge management skills to understand what the assignments entail and strong leadership skills to influence the departments to stay on schedule.\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nTraining is a matter of assessing your team’s skills and abilities, assessing the project needs, and providing the training necessary for the team members to carry out their assigned activities. Training can sometimes be a reward as well. In the software industry, programmers seek out positions that offer training on the latest and greatest technologies, and they consider it a benefit or bonus to attend training on the company dollar and time. If you know early in the Planning processes that training is necessary, include the details of this in the staffing management plan. During the course of the project, you might observe team members that need training or they may ask for training. Update the staffing management plan with this information.\\n\\nTeam\\n\\n\\n\\nBuilding Activities\\n\\nMany times, project teams are made up of folks who don’t know each other. They aren’t neces- sarily aware of the project objectives and may not even want to be a part of the team. The project manager may not have worked with the people assigned to the project team before either. Sound like a recipe for disaster? It’s not. Thousands of projects are started with team members and project managers who don’t know each other and come to a successful completion. How is that done? It’s a result of the project manager’s team-building and communication skills.\\n\\nThe project manager’s job is to bring the team together, get its members all headed in the right direction, and provide motivation, reward, and recognition to keep the team in tip-top shape. This is done using a variety of team-building techniques and exercises. Team building is simply getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most efficient and effective manner possible. This may involve management events as well as individual actions designed to improve team performance. There are entire volumes on this subject, and it’s beyond the scope of this book to go into all the team-building possibilities. The exam tends to focus more on the theories behind team building and the characteristics of effective teams, so that’s what we’ll spend our time looking at.\\n\\nAll newly formed teams go through four stages of development:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nForming\\n\\nStorming\\n\\n3601.book  Page 318  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n318\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\n(cid:2) Norming\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPerforming\\n\\nYou’ve probably seen this elsewhere, but since these stages may show up on the exam, you’ll\\n\\nwant to memorize them. Let’s take a brief look at each of them.\\n\\nForming This one’s easy. Forming is the beginning stage of team formation, when all the mem- bers are brought together, introduced, and told the objectives of the project. This is where team members learn why they’re working together. During this stage, team members tend to be for- mal and reserved and take on an “all-business” approach.\\n\\nStorming Storming is where the action begins. Team members become confrontational with each other as they’re vying for position and control during this stage. They’re working through who is going to be the top dog and jockeying for status.\\n\\nNorming Now things begin to calm down. Team members know each other fairly well by now. They’re comfortable with their positions in the team, and they begin to deal with project problems instead of people problems. In the norming stage, they confront the project concerns and problems instead of each other. Decisions are made jointly at this stage, and team members exhibit affection and familiarity with one another.\\n\\nPerforming Ahh, perfection. Well, almost, anyway. This is where great teams end up. This stage is where the team is productive and effective. The level of trust among team members is high, and great things are achieved. This is the mature development stage.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nDifferent teams progress through the stages of development at different rates. When new team members are brought onto the team, the development stages start all over again. It doesn’t matter where the team is in the forming process—a new member will start the cycle all over again.\\n\\nLet’s take a closer look at focusing your team members throughout these stages of develop-\\n\\nment, along with some of the characteristics of effective teams.\\n\\nTeam Focus\\n\\nHave you ever watched any of those old pirate movies on late-night TV? Remember the scenes where the captain goes down into the bowels of the ship to check on the teams of rowers? He scrutinizes the crew and literally whips the rowers who aren’t pulling their weight into shape. I don’t recommend this as a team-building technique, but imagine for a minute that your project team members are like those rowing teams. If the members on the left are rowing one way and the members on the right are rowing another, you’re creating a lot of energy and looking very busy, but in the end you aren’t making any progress.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 319  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\n319\\n\\nIt’s paramount that the team members know and understand the goals and objectives of the\\n\\nproject. They should all understand the direction you’re headed and work toward that end. After all, that’s the reason they’ve been brought together in the first place. Keep in mind that people see and hear things from their own perspective. A room full of people attending a speech will each come away with something a little different because what was said speaks to their par- ticular situation in life at the time. In other words, their own perceptions filter what they hear. It’s your job as project manager to make certain the team members understand the project goals and their own assignments correctly. The whip was effective for the captain in the old movies, but I suggest you use solid communication skills to get your point across. Ask your team mem- bers to tell you in their own words what they believe the project goals are. This is a great way to know if you’ve got everyone on board and a great opportunity for you to clarify any misun- derstandings regarding the project goals.\\n\\nEffective Team Characteristics\\n\\nEffective teams are typically very energetic teams. Their enthusiasm is contagious, and it feeds on itself. They generate a lot of creativity and become good problem solvers. Teams like this are every project manager’s dream. Investing yourself in team building as well as relationship build- ing—especially when you don’t think you have the time to do so—will bring many benefits. Here’s a sample of the benefits:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nBetter conflict resolution\\n\\nCommitment to the project\\n\\nCommitment to the project team members and project manager\\n\\n(cid:2) High job satisfaction\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnhanced communication\\n\\nA sense of belonging and purpose\\n\\nA successful project\\n\\nDysfunctional teams will typically produce the opposite results of the benefits just listed. Dysfunctional teams don’t just happen by themselves any more than great teams do. Sure, some- times you’re lucky enough to get the right combination of folks together right off the bat. But usually, team building takes work and dedication on the part of the project manager. Even in the situations where you do get that dynamite combination of people, they will benefit from team-building exercises and feedback.\\n\\nUnfortunately, sour attitudes are just as contagious as enthusiasm. Watch for these symp- toms among your team members and take action to correct the situation before the entire team is affected:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nLack of motivation or “don’t care” attitudes\\n\\nProject work that isn’t satisfying\\n\\nStatus meetings that turn into whining sessions\\n\\nPoor communication\\n\\nLack of respect and lack of trust for the project manager\\n\\n3601.book  Page 320  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n320\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nNo amount of team building will make up for poor project planning or ineffec- tive project management techniques. Neglecting these things and fooling yourself into thinking that your project team is good enough to make up for the poor planning or poor techniques could spell doom for your project. And besides that, it’s not fair to your project team to put them in that position.\\n\\nGround Rules\\n\\nGround rules are the expectations you as the project manager set describing acceptable behavior from the team. For example, one of my pet peeves is team members who interrupt each other. In this case, one of the ground rules is one person speaks at a time during a meeting. Another ground rule might be reporting potential issues as soon as the team member becomes aware of them. Outlining ground rules like this helps the team understand your expectations and increases productivity.\\n\\nCollocation\\n\\nTeam members are often in the same physical location—for example, the same office building or office complex. This tool and technique is called collocation. Collocation enables teams to func- tion more effectively than if they’re spread out among different localities. Many times on large projects, the project manager will make provisions in the project budget to bring the team together at the same location. (It’s difficult, but not impossible, to manage project team members who are not physically located together.) One way to achieve collocation might be to set aside a common meeting room, sometimes called a war room, for team members who are located in different build- ings or across town to meet and exchange information.\\n\\nMultiple locations can also be a big time waster for you as the project manager and for your team members. If some team members are located in one part of town and another set of team members are located across town, you’ll find yourself in the car (or the bus) driving back and forth to make face-to-face contact and get status updates. Conducting team meetings also becomes a hassle as one set of team members or the other must drive to another location (or both to a central location) to have a meeting.\\n\\nThere is a lot of value in face-to-face contact with your team members and stakeholders. I’m a huge e-mail fan—it’s one of my favorite forms of communication—but e-mail cannot reveal tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language. Whenever possible, practice the technique of collocation and get your team together.\\n\\nIn reality, it’s often difficult to get your team together physically. A good solu- tion in lieu of having people relocate is conference calling. Team members scattered across the country all have access to the telephone and it’s relatively easy to find a time everyone can meet over the phone.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 321  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\n321\\n\\nRecognition and Rewards\\n\\nWe have quite a bit of ground to cover with recognition and rewards. As I said earlier, there could be several exam questions regarding team building, so dig out all your favorite memori- zation techniques and put them to use.\\n\\nTeam building starts with project planning and doesn’t stop until the project is completed. It involves employing techniques to improve your team’s performance and keeping team mem- bers motivated. Motivation helps people work more efficiently and produce better results. If clear expectations, clear procedures, and the right motivational tools are used, project teams will excel.\\n\\nMotivation can be extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic motivators are material rewards and might include bonuses, the use of a company car, stock options, gift certificates, training opportuni- ties, extra time off, and so on.\\n\\nIntrinsic motivators are specific to the individual. Some people are just naturally driven to achieve—it’s part of their nature. (I suspect this is a motivator for you since you’re reading this book.) Cultural and religious influences are forms of intrinsic motivators as well. Reward and recognition—a tool and technique of the Develop Project Team process—are examples of extrinsic motivators. We’ll look at them next.\\n\\nRecognition and rewards are an important part of team motivation. They are formal ways of recognizing and promoting desirable behavior and are most effective when carried out by the management team and the project manager.\\n\\nRecognition and rewards should be proportional to the achievement. In other words, appro- priately link the reward to the performance. For example, a project manager who has respon- sibility for the project budget and the procurement process and keeps the costs in line with the budget should get rewarded for this achievement. However, if these functions are assigned to a functional manager in the organization, it wouldn’t be appropriate to reward the project man- ager because they were not the one responsible for keeping the costs in line.\\n\\nTeam members should be rewarded for going above and beyond the call of duty. Perhaps they put in a significant amount of overtime to meet a project goal or spent nights round-the- clock babysitting ill-performing equipment. These types of behaviors should get rewarded and formally recognized by the project manager and the management team. On the other hand, if the ill-performing equipment was a direct result of mistakes made or if it happened because of poor planning, rewards would not be appropriate, obviously.\\n\\nConsider individual preferences and cultural differences when using rewards and recogni- tions. Some people don’t like to be recognized in front of a group; others thrive on it. Some people appreciate an honest thank-you with minimal fanfare, and others just won’t accept individual rewards as their culture doesn’t allow it. Keep this in mind when devising your reward system.\\n\\nThere are many theories on motivation. As a project manager, it’s important to understand them so that you can tailor your recognition and rewards programs to take into account the rea- sons people do what they do. You may encounter questions on these theories on the exam, so I’ll discuss their primary points in the following sections.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 322  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n322\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nBaker’s Gift Baskets\\n\\nYou’re a contract project manager for Baker’s Gift Baskets. This company assembles gift bas- kets of all styles and shapes with every edible treat imaginable. The company has recently experienced explosive growth, and you’ve been brought on board to manage its new project. The owners of the company want to offer “pick-your-own” baskets that allow customers to pick the individual items they want included in the basket. In addition, they’re introducing a new line of containers to choose from, including things like miniature golf bags, flowerpots, serving bowls, and the like. This means changes to the catalog and the website to accommodate the new offerings.\\n\\nThe deadline for this project is the driving constraint. The website changes won’t cause any problems with the deadline. However, the catalog must go to press quickly to meet holiday mailing deadlines, which in turn are driving the project deadline.\\n\\nYour team members put their heads together and came up with an ingenious plan to meet the catalog deadline. It required lots of overtime and some weekend work on their part to pull it off, but they met the date.\\n\\nYou decide this is a perfect opportunity to recognize and reward the team for their outstanding efforts. You’ve arranged a slot on the agenda at the next all-company meeting to bring your team up front and praise them for their cooperation and efforts to get the catalog to the printers on time. You’ll also present each of them with two days of paid time off and a gift certificate for a dinner with their family at an exclusive restaurant in the city.\\n\\nMotivational Theories\\n\\nMotivational theories came about during the modern age. Prior to today’s information and ser- vice type jobs and yesterday’s factory work, the majority of people worked the land and barely kept enough food on the table to feed their family. No one was concerned about motivation at work. You worked because you wouldn’t have anything to eat if you didn’t. Fortunately, that isn’t the case today.\\n\\nToday we have a new set of problems in the workplace. Workers in the service and knowledge- based industries aren’t concerned with starvation—that need has been replaced with other needs like job satisfaction, a sense of belonging and commitment to the project, good working condi- tions, and so on. Motivational theories present ideas on why people act the way they do, and how we can influence them to act in certain ways to get the results we want. Again, there are libraries full of books on this topic. We’ll cover four of them here.\\n\\nMASLOW’S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS You have probably seen this classic example of motivational theory. Abraham Maslow hypoth- esized that humans have five basic needs arranged in hierarchical order. The first needs are\\n\\n3601.book  Page 323  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\n323\\n\\nphysical needs, like the need for food, clothing, and shelter. The idea is that these needs must be met before the person can move to the next level of needs in the hierarchy, which includes safety and security needs. Here, the concern is for the person’s physical welfare and the security of their belongings. Once that need is met, they progress to the next level, and so on.\\n\\nMaslow’s hierarchy of needs theory suggests that once a lower-level need has been met, it no longer serves as a motivator and the next higher level becomes the driving motivator in a per- son’s life. Maslow conjectures that humans are always in one state of need or another. Here is a recap of each of the needs, starting with the highest level and ending with the lowest:\\n\\nSelf-actualization Performing at your peak potential\\n\\nSelf-esteem needs Accomplishment, respect for self, capability\\n\\nSocial needs A sense of belonging, love, acceptance, friendship\\n\\nSafety and security needs Your physical welfare and the security of your belongings\\n\\nBasic physical needs Food, clothing, shelter\\n\\nThe highest level of motivation in this theory is the state of self-actualization. The United States Army had a slogan a few years ago that I think encapsulates self-actualization very well: “Be all that you can be.” When all the physical, safety, social, and self-esteem needs have been met, a per- son reaches a state of independence where they’re able to express themselves and perform at their peak. They’ll do good work just for the sake of doing good work. Recognition and self-esteem is the motivator at lower levels; now the need for being the best they can be is reached.\\n\\nHYGIENE THEORY Frederick Herzberg came up with the Hygiene Theory, also known as the Motivation-Hygiene Theory. He postulates that there are two factors that contribute to motivation: hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors deal with work environment issues. The thing to remember about hygiene factors is that they prevent dissatisfaction. Examples of hygiene factors are pay, benefits, the conditions of the work environment, and relationships with peers and managers. Pay is con- sidered a hygiene factor because Herzberg believed that over the long term, pay is not a motivator. Being paid for the work prevents dissatisfaction but doesn’t necessarily bring satisfaction in and of itself. He believed this to be true as long as the pay system is equitable. If two workers perform- ing the same functions have large disparities in pay, then pay can become a motivator.\\n\\nMotivators deal with the substance of the work itself and the satisfaction one derives from performing the functions of the job. Motivators lead to satisfaction. The ability to advance, the opportunity to learn new skills, and the challenges involved in the work are all motivators according to Herzberg.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, remember that Herzberg was the inventor of the Hygiene Theory and that this theory claims that hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction while motivators lead to satisfaction.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 324  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n324\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nEXPECTANCY THEORY The Expectancy Theory says that the expectation of a positive outcome drives motivation. Peo- ple will behave in certain ways if they think there will be good rewards for doing so. Also note that this theory says the strength of the expectancy drives the behavior. This means the expec- tation or likelihood of the reward is linked to the behavior. For example, if you tell your two- year-old to put the toys back in the toy box and you’ll give her a cookie, chances are she’ll put the toys away. This is a reasonable reward for a reasonable action. However, if you promise your project team members vacations in Hawaii if they get the project done early and they know there is no way you can deliver that reward, there is little motivation to work toward it.\\n\\nThis theory also says that people become what you expect of them. If you openly praise your\\n\\nproject team members and treat them like valuable contributors, you’ll likely have a high- performing team on your hands. Conversely, when you publicly criticize people or let them know that you have low expectations regarding their performance, they’ll likely live up (or down as the case may be) to that expectation as well.\\n\\nACHIEVEMENT THEORY Achievement Theory says that people are motivated by the need for three things: achievement, power, and affiliation. The achievement motivation is obviously the need to achieve or succeed. The power motivation involves a desire for influencing the behavior of others. And the need for affiliation is relationship oriented. Workers want to have friendships with their coworkers and a sense of camaraderie with their fellow team members. The strength of your team members’ desire for each of these will drive their performance on various activities.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand the theories of motivation and their premises for the exam.\\n\\nWe’ll cover two more theories in the leadership section, which is next. These deal specifically\\n\\nwith how leaders interact with their project team members.\\n\\nLeadership versus Management\\n\\nChapter 1 talked about leaders versus managers. There’s a bit more information to add here regarding leadership theories and the types of power leaders possess. Let’s recap leadership and management first before we talk about those theories.\\n\\nRecall that leadership is about imparting vision and rallying people around that vision. Lead- ers motivate and inspire and are concerned with strategic vision. Leaders have a knack for get- ting others to do what needs done.\\n\\nTwo of the techniques they use to do this are power and politics. Power is the ability to get people to do what they wouldn’t do ordinarily. It’s also the ability to influence behavior. Politics imparts pressure to conform regardless of whether people agree with the decision. Leaders understand the difference between power and politics and when to employ each technique. We’ll talk more about power shortly.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 325  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDeveloping the Project Team\\n\\n325\\n\\nGood leaders have committed team members who believe in the vision of the leader. Leaders set direction and time frames and have the ability to attract good talent to work for them. Lead- ers inspire a vision and get things done through others by earning loyalty, respect, and cooper- ation from team members. They set the course and lead the way. Good leaders are directive in their approach but allow for plenty of feedback and input. Good leaders commonly have strong interpersonal skills and are well respected.\\n\\nManagers are generally task oriented and concerned with things like plans, controls, bud- gets, policies, and procedures. They’re generalists with a broad base of planning and organiza- tional skills, and their primary goal is satisfying stakeholder needs. They also possess motivational skills and the ability to recognize and reward behavior.\\n\\nProject managers need to use the traits of both leaders and managers at differ- ent times during a project. On very large projects, a project manager will act more like a leader inspiring the sub–project managers to get on board with the objectives. On small projects, project managers will act more like managers because they’re responsible for all the planning and coordinating functions.\\n\\nThere are three theories that we’ll discuss regarding leadership and management. They are Douglas McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y and the Contingency Theory. Then we’ll end this section with a discussion of the types of power leaders use and the outputs of Develop Project Team.\\n\\nTHEORY X AND THEORY Y Douglas McGregor defined two models of worker behavior, Theory X and Theory Y, that attempt to explain how different managers deal with their team members. Theory X managers believe most people do not like work and will try to steer clear of it; they believe people have little to no ambition, need constant supervision, and won’t actually perform the duties of their job unless threatened. As a result, Theory X managers are like dictators and impose very rigid controls over their people. They believe people are motivated only by punishment, money, or position. Unfortunately for the team members, Theory X managers unknowingly also subscribe to the Expectancy Theory. If they expect people to be lazy and unproductive and treat them as such, their team members probably will be lazy and unproductive.\\n\\nTheory Y managers believe people are interested in performing their best given the right motivation and proper expectations. These managers provide support to their teams, are con- cerned about their team members, and are good listeners. Theory Y managers believe people are creative and committed to the project goals, that they like responsibility and seek it out, and that they are able to perform the functions of their positions with limited supervision.\\n\\nCONTINGENCY THEORY The Contingency Theory builds on a combination of Theory Y behaviors and the Hygiene Theory. The Contingency Theory, in a nutshell, says that people are motivated to achieve levels of competency and will continue to be motivated by this need even after competency is reached.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 326  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n326\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nThe Power of Leaders\\n\\nAs stated earlier, power is the ability to influence others to do what you want them to do. This can be used in a positive manner or a negative one. But that old saying of your grandmother’s about attracting more flies with honey than vinegar still holds true today.\\n\\nLeaders, managers, and project managers use power to convince others to do things a specific way. The kind of power they use to accomplish this depends on their personality, their personal values, and the company culture.\\n\\nThere are several forms of power that a project manager might use. We’ve already talked about reward power, which is the ability to grant bonuses or incentive awards for a job well done. Let’s look at a few more:\\n\\nPunishment power Punishment, also known as coercive or penalty power, is just the opposite of reward power. The employee is threatened with consequences if expectations are not met.\\n\\nExpert power Expert power occurs when the person being influenced believes the manager, or the person doing the influencing, is knowledgeable about the subject or has special abilities that make them an expert. The person goes along just because they think the influencer knows what they’re doing and it’s the best thing for the situation.\\n\\nLegitimate power Legitimate, or formal, power comes about as a result of the influencer’s position. Because that person is the project manager, or executive vice president, or CEO, they have the power to call the shots and make decisions.\\n\\nReferent power Referent power is inferred to the influencer by their subordinates. Project team members who have a great deal of respect and high regard for their project managers will- ingly go along with decisions made by the project manager because of referent power.\\n\\nPunishment power should be used as a last resort. There are times when you’ll have to use this\\n\\nmethod, but hopefully much less often than the other three forms of power. Sometimes, you’ll have team members who won’t live up to expectations and their performance suffers as a result. This is a case where punishment power is enacted to get the employee to correct their behavior.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nKnow the Theory of X and Y, the Contingency Theory, and types of power for the PMP exam. Understand the circumstances when each type of power might be used.\\n\\nOutputs of Develop Project Team\\n\\nWe’re now ready to close out the Develop Project Team process. There is only one output of this pro- cess: team performance assessment. As a result of positive team-building experiences, you’ll see indi- viduals improving their skills, team behaviors and relationships improving, conflict resolutions going smoothly, and team members recommending ways to improve the work of the project. We talked about effective team characteristics in an earlier section of this chapter. Assessing these char- acteristics will help you determine where (or if) the project team needs improvements.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 327  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDistributing Project Information\\n\\n327\\n\\nProject managers wear a lot of hats. This is one of the things that make this job so interesting. You need organization and planning skills to plan the project. You need motivation and sometimes disciplinary skills to execute the project plans. You need to exercise leadership and power where appropriate. And all the while, you have a host of relationships to manage, involving team members, stakehold- ers, managers, and customers. It’s a great job and brings terrific satisfaction.\\n\\nDistributing Project Information\\n\\nThe Information Distribution process is concerned with getting stakeholders information about the project in a timely manner. This can come about in several ways: status reports, project meetings, review meetings, and so on. Status reports are actually a part of the work performance information we saw in the output of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process. Status reports inform stakeholders about where the project is today in regard to project schedule and budget, for example. They also describe what the project team has accomplished to date. This might include milestones completed to date, the percentage of schedule completion, and what remains to be completed. The Information Distribution process describes how this report is distributed and to whom.\\n\\nIn the Information Distribution process, the communications management plan that was defined during the Communications Planning process is put into action and it’s the only input to this process. Communication and Information Distribution work together to report the progress of the project team.\\n\\nThere are several tools and techniques of Information Distribution and we’ll look at each of\\n\\nthem next.\\n\\nInformation Distribution Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of this process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCommunication skills\\n\\nInformation gathering and retrieval systems\\n\\nInformation distribution methods\\n\\nLessons learned process\\n\\nCommunication skills are probably the single most important skill in your project manage-\\n\\nment toolbox. We’ll start with this tool and technique.\\n\\nDeveloping Great Communication Skills\\n\\nEvery aspect of your job as a project manager will involve communications. It’s been estimated that project managers spend as much as 90 percent of their time communicating in one form or another. Therefore, communication skills are arguably one of the most important skills a\\n\\n3601.book  Page 328  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n328\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nproject manager can have. They are even more important than technical skills. Good commu- nication skills foster an open, trusting environment. The ability to communicate well is a project manager’s best asset.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, communications skills are not the same as project man- agement communications. They’re related, but not the same thing.\\n\\nChapter 1 talked about how important good communication skills are. This section discusses the act of communication, listening behaviors, and conflict resolution. You’ll employ each of these techniques with your project team, stakeholders, customers, and management team.\\n\\nInformation Exchange\\n\\nCommunication is the process of exchanging information. There are three elements to all communication:\\n\\nSender The sender is the person responsible for putting the information together in a clear and con- cise manner. The information should be complete and presented in a way that the receiver will be able to correctly understand it. Make your messages relevant to the receiver. Junk mail is annoying, and information that doesn’t pertain in any way whatsoever to the receiver is nothing more than that.\\n\\nMessage The message is the information being sent and received. It might be written, verbal, nonverbal, formal, informal, internal, external, horizontal, or vertical. Horizontal communica- tions are messages sent and received to peers. Vertical communications are messages sent and received down to subordinates and up to executive management.\\n\\nMake your messages as simple as you can to get your point across. Don’t compli- cate the message with unnecessary detail and technical jargon that others may not understand. A simple trick that helps clarify your messages, especially verbal mes- sages, is to repeat the key information periodically. Public speakers are taught that the best way to organize a speech is to first tell the audience what you’re going to tell them; second, tell them; and third, tell them what you just told them.\\n\\nReceiver The receiver is the person the message is intended for. They are responsible for under- standing the information correctly and making sure they’ve received all of the information.\\n\\nKeep in mind that receivers filter the information they receive through their knowledge of the subject, culture influences, language, emotions, attitudes, and geographic locations. The sender should take these filters into consideration when sending messages so that the receiver will clearly understand the message that was sent.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 329  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDistributing Project Information\\n\\n329\\n\\nThis book is an example of the sender-message-receiver model. I’m the sender of the information. The message concerns topics you need to know to pass the PMP exam (and if I’ve done my job correctly, is written in a clear and easily understood format). You, the reader, are the receiver.\\n\\nMETHODS OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE Senders, receivers, and messages are the elements of communication. The way the sender pack- ages or encodes the information and transmits it and the way the receiver unpacks or decodes the message are the methods of communication exchange.\\n\\nSenders encode messages. Encoding is a method of putting the information into a format the receiver will understand. Language, pictures, and symbols are used to encode messages. Encod- ing formats the message for transmitting.\\n\\nTransmitting is the way the information gets from the sender to the receiver. Spoken words,\\n\\nwritten documentation, memos, e-mail, voicemail, and so on are all transmitting methods.\\n\\nDecoding is what the receiver does with the information when they get it. They convert it into an understandable format. Usually, this means they read the memo, listen to the speaker, read the book, and so on.\\n\\nFORMS OF COMMUNICATION Communication occurs primarily in written or verbal form. Granted, you can point to some- thing or indicate what you need with motions, but usually you use the spoken or written word to get your message across.\\n\\nVerbal communication is easier and less complicated than written communication, and it’s\\n\\nusually a fast method of communication. Written communication, on the other hand, is an excellent way to get across complex, detailed messages. Detailed instructions are better pro- vided in written form because it gives the reader the ability to go back over information they’re not quite sure about.\\n\\nBoth verbal and written communications might take a formal or an informal approach. Speeches or lectures are an example of formal verbal communications. Most project status meetings take more of a formal approach, as do most written project status reports. Generally speaking, the project manager should take an informal approach when communicating with stakeholders and project team members outside of the status meetings. This makes you appear more open and friendly and easier to approach with questions and issues.\\n\\nEffective Listening Skills\\n\\nWhat did you say? Often we think we’re listening when we really aren’t. In all fairness, we can take in only so much information at one time. But it’s important to perform active listening when someone else is speaking. As a project manager, you will spend the majority of your time communicating with team members, stakeholders, customers, vendors, and others. This means you should be as good a listener as you are a communicator.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 330  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n330\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nThere are several techniques you can use to improve your listening skills. There are books\\n\\ndevoted to this topic, so we’ll try to highlight some of the most common techniques here:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nAppear interested in what the speaker is saying. This will make the speaker feel at ease and will benefit you as well. By acting interested, you become interested and thereby retain more of the information being presented.\\n\\n(cid:2) Making eye contact with the speaker is another effective listening tool. This lets the speaker\\n\\nknow you are paying attention to what they’re saying and are interested.\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPut your speaker at ease by letting them know beforehand that you’re interested in what they’re going to talk about and that you’re looking forward to hearing what they have to say. While they’re speaking, nod your head, smile, or make comments when and if appro- priate to let the speaker know you understand the message. If you don’t understand some- thing and are in the proper setting, ask clarifying questions.\\n\\nAnother great trick that works well in lots of situations is to recap what the speaker said in your own words and tell it back to them. Start with something like this, “Let me make sure I understand you correctly, you’re saying…,” and ask the speaker to confirm that you did understand them correctly.\\n\\nJust as your mother always said, it’s impolite to interrupt. Interrupting is a way of telling the speaker that you aren’t really listening and you’re more interested in telling them what you have to say than listening to them. Interrupting gets the other person off track, they might forget their point, and it may even make them angry.\\n\\nNot to disagree with Mom, but there probably are some occasions where interrupting is appropriate. For example, if you’re in a project status meeting and someone wants to take the meeting off course, sometimes the only way to get the meeting back on track is to interrupt them. You can do this politely. Start first by saying the person’s name to get their attention. Then let them know that you’d be happy to talk with them about their topic outside of the meet- ing or add it to the agenda for the next status meeting if it’s something everyone needs to hear. Sorry, Mom.\\n\\nResolving Conflicts\\n\\nI said earlier in this chapter that if you have more than one person working on your project, you have a team. Here’s another fact: If you have more than one person working on your project, you’ll have conflict. I put conflict resolution in the communication section because conflict res- olution involves communication, as you’ll see in a moment.\\n\\nEveryone has desires, needs, and goals. Conflict comes into the picture when the desires, needs, or goals of one party are incompatible with the desires, needs, or goals of another party (or parties). Conflict, simply put, is the incompatibility of goals, which often leads to one party resisting or blocking the other party from attaining their goals. Wait—this doesn’t sound like a party!\\n\\nThere are five ways of resolving conflict that may show up on the exam:\\n\\nForcing Forcing is just as it sounds. One person forces a solution on the other parties. This is where the boss puts on the “Because I’m the boss and I said so” hat. While this is a permanent solution, it isn’t necessarily the best solution. People will go along with it because, well, they’re\\n\\n3601.book  Page 331  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDistributing Project Information\\n\\n331\\n\\nforced to go along with it. It doesn’t mean they agree with the solution. This isn’t the best tech- nique to use when you’re trying to build a team. This is an example of a win-lose conflict res- olution technique. The forcing party wins, and the losers are those who are forced to go along with the decision.\\n\\nSmoothing Smoothing does not lead to a permanent solution. It’s a temporary way to resolve conflict where someone attempts to make the conflict appear less important than it is. Everyone looks at each other and scratches their head and wonders why they thought the conflict was such a big deal anyway. As a result, a compromise is reached and everyone feels good about the solution until they get back to their desk and start thinking about the issue again. When they realize that the conflict was smoothed over and really is more important than they were led to believe, they’ll be back at it and the conflict will resurface. This is an example of a lose-lose con- flict resolution technique because neither side wins.\\n\\nCompromise Compromise is achieved when each of the parties involved in the conflict gives up something to reach a solution. Everyone involved decides what they will give on and what they won’t give on, and eventually through all the give and take, a solution is reached. Neither side wins or loses in this situation. As a result, neither side is really gung ho about the decision that was reached. They will drag their feet and reluctantly trudge along. If, however, firm commitments are made by both parties to the resolution, then the solution becomes a permanent one.\\n\\nConfrontation Confrontation is also called problem solving and is the best way to resolve conflict. One of the key actions you’ll perform with this technique is a fact-finding mission. The thinking here is that one right solution to a problem exists and the facts will bear out the solution. Once the facts are uncovered, they’re presented to the parties and the decision will be clear. Thus the solution becomes a permanent one and the conflict expires. This is the conflict resolution approach project mangers use most often and is an example of a win-win conflict resolution technique.\\n\\nWithdrawal Withdrawal never results in resolution. This occurs when one of the parties gets up and leaves and refuses to discuss the conflict. It is probably the worst of all the techniques because nothing gets resolved. This is an example of a lose-lose conflict resolution technique.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nKnow each of the conflict resolution techniques for the exam. Also remember that these tech- niques will not necessarily yield long-term results. The smoothing and withdrawal techniques have temporary results and aren’t always good techniques to use to resolve problems. Forcing, compromise, and confrontation techniques tend to have longer-lasting results.\\n\\nKeep in mind that group size makes a difference when you’re trying to resolve conflict or make decisions. Remember the channels of communication you learned about in Chapter 4? The larger the group, the more lines of communication and the more difficult it will be to reach a decision. Groups of 5 to 11 people have been shown to make the most accurate decisions.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 332  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n332\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nUse communication, listening, and conflict resolution skills wisely. As a project manager, you’ll find that your day-to-day activities encompass these three areas the majority of the time. Project managers with excellent communication skills can work wonders. Communication won’t take the place of proper planning and management techniques, but a project manager who communicates well with their team and the stakeholders can make up for a lack of tech- nical skills any day, hands down. If your team and your stakeholders trust you and you can communicate the vision and the project goals and report on project status accurately and hon- estly, the world is your oyster.\\n\\nInformation Gathering and Retrieval Systems\\n\\nThe Information gathering and retrieval systems tool and technique of the Information Distribution process includes ways that project information is stored and shared among project team members. You’ve probably used one or more of these gathering and retrieval systems such as project manage- ment software, manual filing systems, intranet project sites, and electronic databases.\\n\\nInformation Distribution Methods\\n\\nInformation distribution methods are ways of getting the project information to the project team or stakeholders. As the name implies, these are ways to distribute the information and might include e-mail, hard copy, voicemail, videoconferencing, and so on.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nDon’t confuse information gathering and retrieval systems with information distribution meth- ods. Remember that retrieval systems are ways for the project team to get at project informa- tion, while distribution methods are ways of getting the information into the hands of the stakeholders or team members.\\n\\nLessons Learned Process\\n\\nLessons learned is information that you gather and document throughout the course of the project that can be used to benefit the current project, future projects, or other projects currently being performed by the organization. Lessons learned may include positive as well as negative lessons. During the Information Distribution process, you’ll begin conducting lessons learned meet-\\n\\nings focusing on many different areas depending on the nature of your project. These areas might include project management processes, product development, technical processes, project team performance, stakeholder involvement, and so on.\\n\\nLessons learned meetings should always be conducted at the end of project phases and at the end of the project at minimum. Team members, stakeholders, vendors, and others involved on the project should participate in these meetings. It’s important to understand, and to make your team members understand, that this is not a finger pointing meeting. The purpose of lessons learned is to understand what went well and why—so you can repeat it on future projects—and\\n\\n3601.book  Page 333  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDistributing Project Information\\n\\n333\\n\\nwhat didn’t go so well and why—so you can perform differently on future projects. These meet- ings make good team-building sessions because there is an atmosphere of trust and sharing and building on each other’s strengths to improve performance.\\n\\nSome of the updates that may occur as a result of lessons learned meetings are updates to the lessons learned knowledge base, and to policies, procedures, processes, and business skills and updates to the risk management plan.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, it’s a project manager’s professional obligation to hold lessons learned meetings.\\n\\nWe’ll talk more about lessons learned in Chapter 11, “Closing Out the Project.”\\n\\nOutputs of Information Distribution\\n\\nThe first output of the Information Distribution process is organizational process assets updates. The updates here consist of six elements:\\n\\nLessons learned documentation You’ll document the lessons learned we talked about earlier as this output. You should document the reasons or causes for the issues, the corrective action taken and why, and any other information that future projects may benefit from.\\n\\nProject records Project records include, as you might guess, memos, correspondence, and other documents concerning the project. The best place to keep information like this is in a project note- book or in a set of project notebooks, depending on the size of the project. The project notebooks are ordinary three-ring binders where project information gets filed. They are maintained by the project manager or project office and contain all information regarding the project. You could also keep the information on a project website, the company intranet, or CDs. If you’re keeping the information electronically, make certain it’s backed up periodically. Individual team members may keep their own project records as well in notebooks or electronically. These records serve as historical information once the project is closed.\\n\\nProject reports Project reports include the project status reports and minutes from project meet- ings. If you’re keeping an issues log, they would be included with the project reports as well.\\n\\nProject presentations Project presentations involve presenting project information to the stakeholders and other appropriate parties when necessary. The presentations might be formal or informal and depend on the audience and the information being communicated.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 334  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n334\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nFeedback from stakeholders This one ties into lessons learned. Feedback you receive from the stakeholders that can improve future performance on this project or future projects should be captured and documented. If the information has an impact on the current project, distribute it to the appropriate team members so that future project performance can be modified to improve results.\\n\\nStakeholder notifications Remember that the focus of this process is distributing information so this elements fits because you’ll want to notify them when you have implemented solutions and approved changes. This also involves informing them of project status. We’ll cover project status review meetings in the section “Establishing Performance Measurements” in Chapter 9.\\n\\nThe only other output of this process is requested changes, which we’ve talked about before. In the next chapter, we’ll examine the processes associated with finding and selecting ven- dors, administering contracts, managing stakeholders and team members, quality assurance, and reporting on performance.\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nDirk Perrier logs on and finds the following e-mail addressed to all the stakeholders and project team members from you:\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nProject Progress Report\\n\\nProject Name Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nProject Number 081501\\n\\n\\n\\n1910\\n\\nPrepared by Project Manager\\n\\nDate September 20, 2006\\n\\nSection 1: Action Items\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nAction Item 1: Call Cable Vendor—Responsible Party: Ricardo; Resolution Date: 9/14\\n\\nAction Item 2: T1 Connection Status—Responsible Party: Ricardo; Resolution Date: Pending\\n\\nAction Item 3: Build-Out Begins—Responsible Party: Jake; Resolution Date: Pending\\n\\nSection 2: Scheduled and Actual Completion Dates\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSign Lease—Scheduled: 8/21/06; Completed: 8/21/06\\n\\nGomez Contract Signed—Scheduled: 9/12/06; Completed: 9/12/06\\n\\nEthernet Cable Run—Scheduled: 9/18/06; Completed: 9/19/06\\n\\nBuild-Out Started—Scheduled: 9/20/06; Completed: Open\\n\\n3601.book  Page 335  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nDistributing Project Information\\n\\n335\\n\\nSection 3: Activity That Occurred in the Project This Week\\n\\nThe Ethernet cable run was completed without a problem.\\n\\nGomez construction started the build-out process.

There’s a slim possibility that the T1 connection will have occurred by next reporting period.\\n\\nSection 6: Issues\\n\\nWe had to start the build-out on the last day of the cable run (this is called fast-tracking) to keep the project on schedule. Jake and Ricardo reported only minor problems with this arrangement in that the contractors got into each other’s way a time or two. This did not impact the comple- tion of the cable run as most of day two this team was in the back room and Gomez’s crew was in the storefront area.\\n\\nA key member of the Gomez construction crew was out last week due to a family emergency. Gomez assures us that it will not impact the build-out schedule. They replaced the team mem- ber with someone from another project, so it appears so far that build-out is on schedule.\\n\\nRicardo is somewhat concerned about the T1 connection because the phone company won’t return his calls inquiring about status. We’re still ahead of the curve on this one because hard- ware isn’t scheduled to begin testing until January 21. Hardware testing depends on the T1 connection. This is a heads-up at this point, and we’ll carry this as an issue in the status report going forward until it’s resolved.\\n\\nOne of the gourmet food item suppliers Jill uses regularly went out of business.

In Direct and Manage Project Execution, the project plans come to life. Activities are autho- rized to begin and the product or service of the project is produced. Status review meetings are held to inform stakeholders of project progress and updates.\\n\\nAcquire Project Team involves negotiation with other functional managers, project manag-\\n\\ners, and organizational personnel to obtain human resources to complete the work of the project. The project manager may not have control over who will be a part of the team. Avail- ability, ability, experience, interests, and costs are all enterprise environmental factors that should be considered when you are able to choose team members.\\n\\nDevelop Project Team involves creating an open, inviting atmosphere where project team mem- bers will become efficient and cooperative, increasing productivity during the course of the project. It’s the project manager’s job to bring the team together into a functioning, productive group.\\n\\nThere are four stages of team development: forming, storming, norming, and performing. All groups proceed through these stages, and the introduction of a new team member will always start the process over again.\\n\\nCollocation is physically placing team members together in the same location. This might also include a common meeting room or gathering area where team members can meet and col- laborate on the project.\\n\\nSeveral motivational theories exist, including reward and recognition, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the Hygiene Theory, the Expectancy Theory, and the Achievement Theory. These theo- ries conjecture that motivation is driven by several desires including needs, anticipation of expected outcomes, or needs for achievement, power, or affiliation. The Hygiene Theory pro- poses that hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction.\\n\\nLeaders inspire vision and rally people around common goals. Theory X leaders think most\\n\\npeople are motivated only through punishment, money, or position. Theory Y leaders think most people want to perform the best job they can. The Contingency Theory says that people naturally want to achieve levels of competency and will continue to be motivated by the desire for competency even after competency is reached.\\n\\nLeaders exhibit five types of power: reward, punishment, expert, legitimate, and referent power. Communication skills are the most important skills a project manager exercises. People who send messages are responsible for making sure the messages are clear, concise, and complete. Receivers are responsible for understanding the messages correctly and making sure they’ve received all of the information.\\n\\nListening skills put speakers at ease. Several techniques tell your speaker you’re listening attentively, including making eye contact, nodding, asking clarifying questions, and limiting interruptions.\\n\\nInformation Distribution is a matter of getting project information out to the stakeholders. Infor- mation retrieval systems generally store project information and include project management soft- ware, filing cabinets, and electronic databases. Information distribution methods are ways to get the information to the stakeholders and include e-mail, paper, voicemail, or videoconferencing.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 338  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n338\\n\\nChapter 8 (cid:2) Developing the Project Team\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to identify the distinguishing characteristics of Direct and Manage Project Execution. Direct and Manage Project Execution is where the work of the project is performed, and the majority of the project budget is spent during this process.\\n\\nBe able to name the four stages of group formation. The four stages of group formation are forming, storming, norming, and performing.\\n\\nBe able to define Maslow’s highest level of motivation. Self-actualization occurs when a per- son performs at their peak and all lower-level needs have been met.\\n\\nBe able to name the five levels of power. The five levels of power are reward, punishment, expert, legitimate, and referent.\\n\\nBe able to differentiate between senders and receivers of information. Senders are responsi- ble for clear, concise, complete messages, while receivers are responsible for understanding the message correctly.\\n\\nBe able to identify the five styles of conflict resolution. The five styles of conflict resolution are forcing, smoothing, compromise, confrontation, and withdrawal.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 339  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\n339\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

You are a project manager for a growing dairy farm. It offers its organic dairy products region- ally and is expanding its operations to the West Coast. It is in the process of purchasing and leas- ing dairy farms to get operations under way. You are in charge of the network operations part of this project. An important deadline is approaching that depends on the successful completion of the testing phase. You’ve detected some problems with your hardware in the testing phase and discover that the hardware is not compatible with other network equipment. You take correc- tive action and exchange the hardware for more compatible equipment. Which of the following statements is true?\\n\\nA. This is not a corrective action because corrective action involves human resources, not\\n\\nproject resources.\\n\\nB. Corrective action is taken here to make sure the future project outcomes are aligned with the\\n\\nproject management plan.\\n\\nC.

The Execut- ing processes covered in this chapter are Request Seller\\n\\nResponses, Select Sellers, and Perform Quality Assurance. Then we’ll move into the Monitoring and Controlling process group and examine several processes, including Monitor and Control Project Work, Contract Administration, Manage Project Team, Manage Stakeholders, and Per- formance Reporting.\\n\\nRequest Seller Responses and Select Sellers are both Executing processes. They are usually performed in conjunction with the Contract Administration process, which belongs to the Mon- itoring and Controlling process group. In order to keep the dividing line even, we’ll talk about Request Seller Responses and Select Sellers together and then finish up the Executing process group with Perform Quality Assurance. Then we’ll introduce the Monitor and Control Project work process because it provides the framework for the Monitoring and Controlling process. Then\\n\\nwe’ll cover the Contract Administration process.\\n\\nThe Monitoring and Controlling process group involves taking measurements and perform- ing inspections to find out if there are variances in the plan. If variances are discovered, correc- tive action is taken to get the project back on track and the affected project Planning processes are repeated to make adjustments to the plan as a result of the variances.\\n\\nDuring the Manage Team Project process, you’ll monitor the performance of the team, pro- vide feedback to team members, resolve issues, and take actions (when needed) to realign the project team’s performance with the goals of the project. The Manage Stakeholders process involves communicating project status and issues and resolving stakeholder issues and con- cerns. Performance Reporting also concerns communicating information about the project’s progress to the stakeholders.\\n\\nOnce again we have a lot of ground to cover. Grab your favorite beverage and dig in.\\n\\nRequesting Seller Responses\\n\\nMany times project managers must purchase goods or services to complete some or all of the work Request Seller Responses of the project. Sometimes the entire project is completed on contract. The process is concerned with obtaining responses to bids and proposals from potential vendors.\\n\\nThere are three inputs to this process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nProcurement management plan\\n\\nProcurement documents\\n\\n3601.book  Page 349  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nRequesting Seller Responses\\n\\n349\\n\\nWe’ve talked about these in previous chapters. Organizational process assets were discussed in several of the Planning processes we’ve covered in previous chapters. The procurement doc- uments and procurement management plan were prepared during the Plan Contracting process. We talked about them in Chapter 6, “Resource Planning.” Procurement documents include requests for proposals (RFPs), requests for information (RFIs), requests for quotations (RFQs), and so on. The vendors—or potential sellers—bear the majority of work in the Request Seller Responses process by preparing responses to the RFPs. Depending on the RFP and the effort needed to respond, costs to the vendor can become quite substantial.\\n\\nThe Request Seller Responses process is only used if you’re obtaining goods or services from outside your own organization. If you have all the resources you need to perform the work of the project within the organization, you won’t use this process.\\n\\nIn the following sections we’ll examine some new tools and techniques that will help vendors give you a better idea of their responses and then we’ll move on to the outputs of this process, one of which is the vendor proposal.\\n\\nRequesting Seller Responses Tools and Techniques\\n\\nRemember that the purpose of the Request Seller Responses process is to obtain responses to your RFP (or similar procurement document). The three tools and techniques of this process are actually designed to assist the vendors in getting their proposals to you:\\n\\nBidder conferences\\n\\nare meetings with prospective vendors or sellers that Bidder conferences occur prior to the completion of their response proposal. A bidder conference is prearranged by you or someone from your procurement department. The purpose is to allow all prospective vendors to meet with the buyers to ask questions and clarify issues they have regarding the project and the RFP. The meeting is held once, and all vendors attend at the same time. The bid- der conference is held before the vendor prepares their responses so that they are sure their RFP response will address the project requirements.\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\nAdvertising pany’s Internet site, professional journals, or newspapers are examples of where advertising might appear.\\n\\nis letting potential vendors know that an RFP is available. The com-\\n\\nDevelop qualified seller lists\\n\\nis part of the organizational process\\n\\nDevelop qualified sellers lists asset input if they already exist in the organization. If the lists don’t exist, you’ll have to create them. They are lists of prospective sellers who have been preapproved or prequalified to provide contract services (or provide supplies and materials) for the organization. For example, your orga- nization might require vendors to register and maintain information regarding their experience, offerings, and current prices on a qualified seller list. Vendors must usually go through the pro- curement department to get placed on the list. Project managers are then required to choose their vendors from the qualified seller list published by the procurement department. However, not all organizations have qualified seller lists. If a list isn’t available, you’ll have to work with the project team to come up with your own requirements for selecting vendors.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 350  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n350\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2)\\n\\nMeasuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nRequest Seller Responses Outputs\\n\\nThere are three outputs to the Request Seller Responses process: qualified sellers list, procure- ment document package, and proposals. We talked about developing qualifying seller lists in the last section. The output here can be the qualified seller lists you used as inputs (as part of the orga- nizational process asset input) if they exist. If they don’t exist, you’ll need to develop them as an input and use them as an output.\\n\\nThe procurement document package is prepared by the buyer. This is the formal request that’s posted, advertised, or otherwise sent to each of the sellers and is the basis for the seller’s bid. These might be an RFP, RFQ, IFB, and so on.\\n\\nProposals are the seller-prepared documents that describe how the vendor intends to meet the needs of your project. And if they’ve done their job correctly, the proposal should detail responses to each of the items as they were outlined in your RFP. These proposals become the input to the next process, Select Sellers. After proposals are prepared and submitted, often ven- dors are invited to an oral presentation where they provide additional information about their product or service and buyers may ask questions about the seller’s proposal.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK the Select Sellers process that you should know: Request Seller Responses proposals; Select Sellers is the award a winner.\\n\\nmakes a distinction between the Request Seller Responses process and bids and of bids and proposals and evaluating each in order to\\n\\nobtains\\n\\nreceipt\\n\\nSelecting Sellers\\n\\nSelect Sellers\\n\\nIn the evaluation criteria.

Proposals, as mentioned, are obtained in the Request Seller Responses process and used as an\\n\\n3601.book  Page 351  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nEvaluation Criteria\\n\\n351\\n\\ninput to the Select Sellers process. Proposals may be divided into sections, including a manage- ment section, technical approach, and pricing section. Remember that while cost might be the primary driver behind your decision, the low-cost provider may not end up being low cost in the end if they are unable to deliver the products or services as described and on time. Take the time to evaluate the proposals on more than cost alone.\\n\\nEvaluation criteria is what you’ll use to compare proposals. You developed evaluation cri- teria as part of the Plan Contracting process in Chapter 6. However, let’s take a little closer look at this topic now since you’ll actually be using the criteria during this process.\\n\\nIn practice, you will probably perform Plan Contracting, Request Seller Responses, and Select Sellers all as one process.\\n\\nEvaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluation criteria to the Select Sellers process, not a tool and technique, even though you’ll be using it as you would a tool and technique.\\n\\nis one method of rating and scoring proposals. Keep in mind this is an input\\n\\nThe types of goods and services you’re trying to procure will dictate how detailed your eval- uation criteria is. (Of course, if your organization has policies in place for evaluating proposals, then you’ll use the format or criteria already established.) The selection of some goods and ser- vices may be price driven only. In other words, the bidder with the lowest price will win the bid. This is typical when the items you’re buying are widely available.\\n\\nWhen you’re purchasing goods, you might request a sample from each vendor in order to compare quality (or some other criteria) against your need. For example, perhaps you need a special kind of paper stock for a project you’re working on at a bank. This stock must have a watermark, it must have security threads embedded through the paper, and when the paper is used for printing, the ink must not be erasable. You can request samples of stock from the ven- dors with these qualities and then test them out to see if they’ll work for your project.\\n\\nIt’s always appropriate to ask the vendor for references, especially when you’re hiring con- tract services. It’s difficult to assess the quality of services because it’s not a tangible product. References can tell you if the vendor delivered on time, if they had the technical capability to perform the work, and if their management approach was appropriate when troubles surfaced. Create a list of questions to ask the references before you call.\\n\\nFinancial records may be requested to assure you—the buyer—that the vendor has the fiscal ability to perform the services they’re proposing and that they can purchase whatever equipment is needed to perform the services. If you examine the records of the company and find they’re two steps away from bankruptcy, they may not be a likely candidate for your project. (Remember those general management skills? Here’s another example where they come into play.)\\n\\nOne of the most important criteria is the evaluation of the response itself to determine if the vendor has a clear understanding of what you’re asking them to do or provide. If they missed\\n\\n3601.book  Page 352  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n352\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2)\\n\\nMeasuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nthe mark (remember, they had an opportunity at the bidder conferences to ask clarifying ques- tions) and didn’t understand what you were asking them to provide, you’ll probably want to rank them very low.\\n\\nNow you can compare each proposal against the criteria and rate or score each proposal for its ability to meet or fulfill these criteria. This can serve as your first step in eliminating vendors that don’t match your criteria. Let’s say you received 18 responses to an RFP. After evaluating each one, you discover that 6 of them don’t match all the evaluation criteria. Those 6 vendors are eliminated in this round. The next step is to apply the tools and techniques of this process to further evaluate the remaining 12 potential vendors.\\n\\nTools and Techniques of Select Sellers\\n\\nThe following tools and techniques of Select Sellers are used to further evaluate vendors:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nWeighting systems\\n\\nIndependent estimates\\n\\nScreening systems\\n\\nContract negotiation\\n\\nSeller rating systems\\n\\nExpert judgment\\n\\nProposal evaluation techniques\\n\\nLet’s look at each one.\\n\\nWeighting Systems\\n\\nWeighting systems assign numerical weights to evaluation criteria and then multiply them by the A Guide weights of each criteria factor to come up with total scores for each vendor. According to this tool and technique quantifies the qualitative data to keep personal biases to to the PMBOK, a minimum. Weighting systems are useful when you have multiple vendors to choose from because they allow you to rank-order the proposals to determine the sequence of negotiations.\\n\\nThere is an example of a weighted scoring system in Chapter 2, “Creating the Project Charter and\\n\\nPreliminary Scope Statement.” These systems are commonly used to evaluate vendor proposals.\\n\\nIndependent Estimates\\n\\nYour procurement department might conduct ) of the costs of the proposal and use these to compare to the vendor prices. If there cost estimates are large differences between the independent estimate and the proposed vendor cost, one of two things is happening: The statement of work (SOW), or the terms of the contract, was not\\n\\nindependent estimates\\n\\n(also known as\\n\\nshould\\n\\n3601.book  Page 353  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nTools and Techniques of Select Sellers\\n\\n353\\n\\ndetailed enough to allow the vendor to come up with an accurate cost, or the vendor simply failed to respond to all the requirements laid out in the contract or SOW.\\n\\nScreening Systems\\n\\nuse predefined performance criteria to screen out vendors. Perhaps your\\n\\nScreening systems project requires board-certified engineers. One of the screening criteria would be that vendors propose project team members who have this qualification. If they don’t, they’re eliminated from the selection process.\\n\\nWeighting systems and screening systems are often used in combination to come up with a\\n\\nselection.\\n\\nContract Negotiation\\n\\ncontract negotiation,\\n\\nIn both parties come to an agreement regarding the contract terms. Nego- tiation skills are put into practice here as the details of the contract are ironed out between the parties. At a minimum, contract language should include price, responsibilities, regulations or laws that apply, and the overall approach to the project.\\n\\nfait accompli\\n\\nYou might see the term\\n\\nshow up on the exam. Fait accompli tactics are used during contract negotiation when one party tries to convince the other party discussing a par- ticular contract item that it is no longer an issue. It’s a distraction technique, as the party prac- ticing fait accompli tactics is purposely trying to keep from negotiating an issue and claims the issue cannot be changed. For example, during negotiations the vendor tells you that the key resource they’re assigning to your project must start immediately or you’ll lose that resource and they’ll get assigned work elsewhere. However, you don’t know—because the vendor didn’t tell you—that they can reserve this resource for your project and hold them until the start date. They used fait accompli tactics to push you into starting the project, or hiring this resource, sooner than you would have otherwise.\\n\\nSeller Rating Systems\\n\\nuse information about the sellers—such as past performance, delivery, con- Seller rating systems tract compliance, and quality ratings—to determine seller performance. Your organization may have seller rating systems in place and you should check with your procurement department to see if they exist for the bidders on your project. Part of the Contract Administration process (we’ll talk about this one later in this chapter) concerns gathering and recording this type of information. Don’t use seller rating systems as your sole criteria for evaluating vendors.\\n\\nExpert Judgment\\n\\nExpert judgment applies here as it has on many of the other processes we’ve discussed. Include experts from all areas of the organization when evaluating proposals and selecting vendors. Don’t forget your legal and financial folks, marketing, sales, engineering, and so on.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 354  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n354\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2)\\n\\nMeasuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nProposal Evaluation Techniques\\n\\nProposal evaluation techniques are a combination of all the techniques we’ve just talked about. All techniques use some form of expert judgment and evaluation criteria—whether it’s objective or subjective criteria. The evaluation criteria are usually weighted, much like a weighted scoring system, and those participating as reviewers provide their ratings (usually to the project man- ager) to compile into a weighted proposal to determine an overall score.\\n\\nAfter all the RFPs are examined and scored, we move to the outputs of this process, where\\n\\nsellers are selected and contracts awarded.\\n\\nVendor Selection for Fitness Counts HR System\\n\\nAmanda Jacobson is the project manager for Fitness Counts, a nationwide chain of gyms con- taining all the latest and greatest fitness equipment, aerobics classes, swimming pools, and such.\\n\\nFitness Counts is converting its human resources system. There are several requirements that were specifically addressed in the RFP, including the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe new system must run on a platform that’s compatible with the company’s current operating system.\\n\\nHardware must be compatible with company standards.\\n\\nData conversion of existing HR data must be included in the price of the bid.\\n\\nFitness Counts wants to have the ability to add its own custom modules using internal pro- grammers.\\n\\nTraining of Fitness Counts programmers must be included in the bid.\\n\\nThe project team is in the Select Sellers process and has received bids based on the RFP pub- lished earlier this month. Fitness Counts is using a combination of selection criteria and weighted scoring model to choose a vendor.\\n\\nOne of the evaluation criteria said that the vendor must have prior experience with a project like this. Four vendors met that criteria and proceeded to the weighted scoring selection process.\\n\\nAmanda is one of the members of the selection committee. She and four other members on the committee rated the four vendors who met the initial selection criteria. The results are shown in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 (following this sidebar).\\n\\nVendor C is the clear winner of this bid. Based on the weighted scoring model, their responses to the RFP came out ahead of the other bidders. Amanda calls them with the good news and also calls the other vendors to thank them for participating in the bid. Vendor C is awarded the contract, and Amanda moves on to the Contract Administration process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 355  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nSelect Sellers Outputs\\n\\n355\\n\\nT A B L E 9 . 1\\n\\nExample Weighted Scoring Model\\n\\nVendor A\\n\\nWeighting\\n\\nFactor\\n\\nVendor A\\n\\nScore\\n\\nVendor B\\n\\nWeighting\\n\\nFactor\\n\\nVendor B\\n\\nScore\\n\\nWeight\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n—\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n15\\n\\n12\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n58\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n20\\n\\n12\\n\\n54\\n\\nCriteria\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nData Conversion\\n\\nCustom Modules/\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nTotals\\n\\n1–5; 5 highest\\n\\nT A B L E 9 . 2\\n\\nExample Weighted Scoring Model\\n\\nVendor C\\n\\nWeighting\\n\\nFactor\\n\\nVendor C\\n\\nScore\\n\\nVendor D\\n\\nWeighting\\n\\nFactor\\n\\nVendor D\\n\\nScore\\n\\nCriteria\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nData Conversion\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\nCustom Modules/Training 3\\n\\nTotals\\n\\n1–5; 5 highest\\n\\n20\\n\\n16\\n\\n20\\n\\n12\\n\\n68\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n15\\n\\n12\\n\\n10\\n\\n16\\n\\n53\\n\\nSelect Sellers Outputs\\n\\nThe Select Sellers process has six outputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSelected sellers\\n\\nContract\\n\\nContract management plan\\n\\n3601.book  Page 356  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n356\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nResource availability\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nSelected sellers is obvious; you choose the seller or sellers that you’ll award the project to. We’ll talk more about the contract and the contract management plan next. The other outputs have been discussed previously.\\n\\nElements of a Contract\\n\\nYou may recall that a contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties, typ- ically used to acquire goods or services. Contracts have several names, including agreements, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), subcontracts, and purchase orders.\\n\\nThe type of contract you’ll award will depend on the product or services you’re procuring and your organizational policies. We talked about the types of contracts—fixed price, cost reim- bursable, and so on—in Chapter 6 if you need a refresher. If your project has multiple sellers, you’ll award contracts for each of them.\\n\\nThe contract should clearly address the elements of the SOW, time period of performance, pricing and payment plan, acceptance criteria, warranty periods, dispute resolution procedures, and so on.\\n\\nSince contracts are legally binding and obligate your organization to fulfill the terms, they’ll likely be subject to some intensive review, and often by several different people. Be certain you understand your organization’s policies on contract review and approval before proceeding.\\n\\nContracts, like projects, have a life cycle of their own. You might encounter questions on the\\n\\nexam regarding the stages of the contract life cycles, so let’s look at this topic next.\\n\\nContract Life Cycles\\n\\nThe contract life cycle consists of four stages:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRequirement\\n\\nRequisition\\n\\nSolicitation\\n\\nAward\\n\\nThese stages are closely related to the following Project Procurement knowledge areas pro-\\n\\ncesses from A Guide to the PMBOK:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPlan Purchases and Acquisitions\\n\\nPlan Contracting\\n\\nRequest Seller Responses\\n\\nSelect Sellers\\n\\nA description of each of the contract life cycles follows.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 357  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nSelect Sellers Outputs\\n\\n357\\n\\nRequirement\\n\\nThe requirement stage is the equivalent of A Guide to the PMBOK’s Plan Purchases and Acqui- sitions process, which was discussed in Chapter 6. The project and contract needs are estab- lished in this cycle, and the requirements of the project are defined. The SOW is used to define the work of the project, the objectives, and a high-level overview of the deliverables. A work breakdown structure (WBS) is developed, a make-or-buy analysis takes place, and cost esti- mates are determined.\\n\\nThe SOW is provided by the buyer when the project is performed under contract to describe\\n\\nthe requirements of the project. The product description can serve as the SOW.\\n\\nRequisition\\n\\nThe requisition stage is similar to A Guide to the PMBOK’s Plan Contracting process, discussed in Chapter 6.\\n\\nIn the requisition stage, the project objectives are refined and confirmed. Solicitation mate- rials such as the request for proposals (RFP), request for information (RFI), and request for quo- tations (RFQ) are prepared during this phase. Generally, the project manager is the one responsible for preparing the RFP, RFI, and RFQ. A review of the potential qualified vendors takes place, including checking references and reviewing other projects the vendor has worked on that are similar to your proposed project.\\n\\nSolicitation\\n\\nThe solicitation stage is where vendors are asked to compete for the contract and respond to the RFP. You will use the tools and techniques of A Guide to the PMBOK’s Request Seller Responses process during this contract stage. The resulting output is the proposals.\\n\\nAward\\n\\nVendors are chosen, and contracts are awarded and signed during the award stage. The equiv- alent to the award stage in A Guide to the PMBOK is the Select Sellers process.\\n\\nThe project manager—or the selection committee, depending on the organizational policy— receives the bids and proposals during the award phase and applies evaluation criteria to each in order to score or rank the responses. After ranking each of the proposals, an award is made to the winning vendor and the contract is written.\\n\\nOnce you have a contract, someone has to administer it. In large organizations, this respon- sibility will fall to the procurement department. The project manager should still have a solid understanding of administering contracts because they’ll work with the procurement depart- ment to determine the satisfactory fulfillment of the contract.\\n\\nContract Management Plan\\n\\nThe contract management plan describes the contract administrative activities of the project. The plan also outlines how the contract will be administered based on the SOW elements in the con- tract, delivery requirements, and performance requirements both the buyer and the seller must meet. The contract management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 358  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n358\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nLaying Out Quality\\n\\nAssurance Procedures\\n\\nThe Quality Planning process laid out the quality standards for the project and determined how those standards are satisfied. The Perform Quality Assurance process involves performing sys- tematic quality activities and uses quality audits to determine which processes should be used to achieve the project requirements and to assure they are performed efficiently and effectively. Project team members, the project manager, and the stakeholders are responsible for the quality assurance of the project. It could be that a quality assurance department or organization is assigned to the project to oversee these processes. In that case, quality assurance may be pro- vided to (rather than part of) the project team, the stakeholders (whether they are involved in the work of the project or not), the customer, the project sponsor, or the management team. The project manager will have the greatest impact on the quality of the project during this process. We’ll review the inputs to this process next and then spend some time exploring a few new\\n\\ntools and techniques for assuring a quality product and project.\\n\\nInputs to Perform Quality Assurance\\n\\nThe inputs to Perform Quality Assurance are what you use to measure the organizational project quality management processes against. The quality management processes were defined during Quality Planning. The inputs to the Perform Quality Assurance process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality management plan\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality metrics\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProcess improvement plan\\n\\n(cid:2) Work performance information\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality control measurements\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nImplemented change requests\\n\\nImplemented corrective actions\\n\\nImplemented defect repair\\n\\nImplemented preventive action\\n\\nYou’ve heard about the inputs to Perform Quality Assurance before so we’ll move right into\\n\\nthe tools and techniques of this section.\\n\\nPerform Quality Assurance Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThere are four tools and techniques of the Perform Quality Assurance process: quality planning tools and techniques, quality audits, process analysis, and quality control tools and techniques.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 359  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nLaying Out Quality Assurance Procedures\\n\\n359\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe most important thing to remember about Perform Quality Assurance is that quality man- agement processes are what you use to make certain the project satisfies the quality standards laid out in the project management plan.\\n\\nWe discussed quality planning tools and techniques along with the Quality Planning process in Chapter 6. You’ll recall that the tools and techniques are cost benefit analysis, benchmarking, design of experiments, and cost of quality. These tools can be used during this process as well to measure project performance.\\n\\nThe quality control tools and techniques listed in this process are the same tools and tech- niques discussed in the Perform Quality Control process we’ll talk about in Chapter 11, “Con- trolling Work Results and Closing Out the Project.” We’ll look at the remaining tools and techniques in the following sections.\\n\\nQuality Audits\\n\\nQuality audits are independent reviews performed by trained auditors or third-party reviewers. The purpose of a quality audit is the same as the purpose of the Perform Quality Assurance pro- cess, to identify ineffective and inefficient processes used on the project. These audits may exam- ine and uncover inefficient processes and procedures as well.\\n\\nQuality audits may be performed on a regular schedule or at random depending on the orga-\\n\\nnizational policies. Quality audits performed correctly will provide the following benefits:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe product of the project is fit for use and meets safety standards.\\n\\nApplicable laws and standards are adhered to.\\n\\nCorrective action is recommended and implemented where necessary.\\n\\nThe quality plan for the project is adhered to.\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality improvements are identified.\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe implementation of approved change requests, corrective actions, preventive actions, and defect repairs are confirmed.\\n\\nQuality improvements come about as a result of the quality audits. During the course of the audit, you may discover ways of improving the efficiency or effectiveness of the project, thereby increasing the value of the project and more than likely exceeding stakeholder expectations.\\n\\nQuality improvements are implemented by submitting change requests or taking corrective action (two of the outputs of this process). Quality improvements interface with the Monitoring and Controlling processes because of the need to file change requests.\\n\\nWe’ll look at change requests and change request procedures in Chapter 10, “Measuring and Reporting Project Objectives.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 360  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n360\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nQuality audits are generally performed by experienced specialists. The specialist’s job is to produce an independent evaluation of the quality process. Some organizations are large enough to have their own quality assurance departments or quality assurance teams; others may have to hire contract personnel to perform this function. Internal quality assurance teams report results to the project team and management team of the organization. External quality assurance teams report results to the customer.\\n\\nProcess Analysis\\n\\nProcess analysis looks at process improvement from an organizational and technical perspec- tive. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, process analysis follows the steps in the process improvement plan and examines the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProblems experienced while conducting the project\\n\\nConstraints of the project\\n\\nInefficient and ineffective processes identified during process operation\\n\\nOne of the techniques of process analysis includes performing root cause analysis. (We talked about root cause analysis in the Risk Identification process in Chapter 4.) While you’re exam- ining problems and constraints, for example, you should look for what’s causing the problem. The result of this exercise will allow you to develop preventive actions for problems that are similar to the problem you’re examining or that have the similar root causes.\\n\\nPerform Quality Assurance Outputs\\n\\nThere are four outputs of the Perform Quality Assurance process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets updates\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nNone of these are new, but there is one new idea embedded in the recommended corrective actions output. During this process, the recommended corrective actions, whether they are a result of a quality audit or process analysis, should be acted upon immediately. Let’s say you’re manufacturing parts for one of the deliverables of your project. Obviously, the moment you dis- cover that the parts are not correct, you’d correct the process by calibrating the machine per- haps, or using different raw materials, to make certain the parts are produced accurately.\\n\\nWe’ve completed the Executing process group with the Perform Quality Assurance process.\\n\\nRemember that the Executing processes and Monitoring and Controlling processes serve as inputs to each other and that Executing and Monitoring and Controlling are both iterative pro- cess groups. As your project progresses and it becomes evident controls need to be exercised to get the project back on track, you’ll come back through the Executing process group and then proceed back through the Monitoring and Controlling processes again. Let’s move on to the Monitoring and Controlling process group now and find out what it’s all about.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 361  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nMonitor and Control Project Work\\n\\n361\\n\\nQuality Improvements\\n\\nWhile it isn’t stated as an output, one of the overarching goals of the Perform Quality Assurance process is to provide a foundation for continuous process improvements. As the name implies, continuous improvements are iterative. This process of continuous improvements sets the stage, so to speak, for improving the quality of all the project processes. This can mean project management processes, but it also means the processes involved in accomplishing the work of the project, or the organizational business processes.\\n\\nWe talked about continuous improvement in Chapter 4; however, there a few more things you need to know about it. The advantage of continuous process improvement is that it reduces the time the project team spends on ineffective or inefficient processes. If the activities don’t help you meet the goals of the project or, worse yet, hinder your progress, it’s time to look at ways to improve them. A Guide to the PMBOK states that the organizational business processes are the objective for process improvement identification and review.\\n\\nMonitor and Control Project Work\\n\\nThe processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrate on monitoring and measuring project performance to identify variances from the project plan and get it back on track.\\n\\nThe Monitor and Control Project Work process is concerned with monitoring all the pro- cesses in the Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing process groups. Collecting data, mea- suring results, and reporting on performance information are some of the activities you’ll perform during this process.\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, the Monitor and Control Project Work process\\n\\ninvolves the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nReporting and comparing actual project results against the project management plan\\n\\nAnalyzing performance data and determining if corrective or preventive action should be recommended\\n\\n(cid:2) Monitoring the project for risks to make certain they’re identified and reported, their status\\n\\nis documented, and the appropriate risk response plans have been put into action\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDocumenting all appropriate product information throughout the life of the project\\n\\nGathering, recording, and documenting project information that provides project status, measurements of progress, and forecasting to update cost and schedule information that is reported to stakeholders, project team members, management, and others\\n\\n(cid:2) Monitoring approved change requests\\n\\n3601.book  Page 362  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n362\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nMonitor and Control Project Work Inputs\\n\\nThe inputs of this process include project management plan, work performance information, and rejected change requests. We’ve covered project management plan and work performance information in previous chapters. Rejected change requests should be documented so that if a request to perform the change comes up in the future, or there’s a question about the disposition of the request, there’s a record of what the change request was about and why it was rejected.\\n\\nTools and Techniques of Monitor and Control Project Work\\n\\nWe’ve seen most all of the tools and techniques of the Monitor and Control Project Work process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management methodology\\n\\nProject management information system\\n\\nEarned value technique\\n\\nExpert judgment\\n\\nWe’ll look more closely at the earned value technique during the discussion of the Cost Con-\\n\\ntrol process, which we’ll cover in Chapter 10.\\n\\nMonitor and Control Project Work Outputs\\n\\nThe outputs of the Monitor and Control Project Work process will also look familiar. They are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions\\n\\nRecommended preventive actions\\n\\nForecasts\\n\\nRecommended defect repair\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nThe forecasts output includes information that has been gathered concerning project perfor- mance and used to predict future project outcomes. For example, the amount of time it’s taken to complete the project activities to date might be used to help predict how much longer the project will take to complete.\\n\\nWe’ll examine several formulas that will help us do this in the next chapter.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 363  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nAdministering the Contract\\n\\n363\\n\\nAdministering the Contract\\n\\nLet’s shift our focus back to the procurement arena. We talked about Request Seller Responses and Select Sellers earlier in this chapter. Now that the contract has been awarded, we need to administer it.\\n\\nThe Contract Administration process concerns monitoring the vendor’s performance and ensuring that all the requirements of the contract are met. When there are multiple vendors pro- viding goods and services to the project, Contract Administration entails coordinating the inter- faces among all the vendors as well as administering each of the contracts. If vendor A has a due date that will impact whether or not vendor B can perform their service, the management and coordination of the two vendors become important. Vendor A’s contract and due dates must be monitored closely because failure to perform could impact other vendor’s ability to perform, not to mention the project schedule. You can see how this situation could multiply quickly when you have six or seven or more vendors involved.\\n\\nIt’s imperative that the project manager and project team are aware of any con- tract agreements that may impact the project so the team does not inadvert- ently take action that violates the terms of the contract.\\n\\nDepending on the size of the organization, administering the contract might fall to someone in the procurement department. This doesn’t mean that you’re off the hook as the project man- ager. It’s still your responsibility to oversee the process and make sure the project objectives are being met, regardless of whether a vendor is performing the activities or your project team mem- bers are performing the activities. You’ll be the one monitoring the performance of the vendor and informing them when and if performance is lacking. You’ll also monitor the contract’s financial conditions. For example, the seller should be paid in a timely manner when they’ve sat- isfactorily met the conditions of the contract and it will be up to you to let the procurement department know it’s okay to pay the vendor. If administering the contract is your responsibil- ity, you may have to terminate the contract when the vendor violates the terms or doesn’t meet the agreed-upon deliverables. If the procurement department has this responsibility, you’ll have to document the situation and provide this to the procurement department so that they can enforce or terminate the contract.\\n\\nAdministering the contract is closely linked with project management processes. You’ll mon- itor the progress of the contract, execute plans, track costs, measure outputs, approve changes, take corrective action, and report on status, just as you do for the project itself. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, integration and coordination of the Direct and Manage Project Plan Execution, Performance Reporting, Perform Quality Control, Integrated Change Control, and Risk Monitoring and Control processes must be applied during Contract Administration.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 364  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n364\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nYou might find several questions on the exam that involve the Request Seller Responses, Select Sellers, and Contract Administration processes. While Contract Administration belongs to the Monitoring and Controlling group, these processes are usually performed in the order stated here.\\n\\nContracting Inputs\\n\\nThere are six inputs to Contract Administration:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nContract\\n\\nContract management plan\\n\\nSelected sellers\\n\\nPerformance reports\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\n(cid:2) Work performance information\\n\\nThe contract, contract management plan, and selected sellers are outputs from the Select Sell- ers process. We’ll cover performance reports in more depth in Chapter 11, “Closing Out the Project.” Performance reports for the Contract Administration process includes information related to the seller (or vendor).\\n\\nApproved Change Requests\\n\\nSometimes as you get into the work of the project, you’ll discover changes need to be made. This could entail changes to the contract as well. Approved change requests are used to process the project or contract changes and might include things like modifications to deliverables, changes to the product or service of the project, changes in contract terms, or termination for poor per- formance. Contracts can be amended at any time prior to contract completion provided the changes are agreed to by all parties and conform to the change control processes outlined in the contract.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nWork performance information is an output of the Direct and Manage Project Execution pro- cess. The results you gather in the Contract Administration process are actually collected as part of the Direct and Manage Project Execution work result output.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 365  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nAdministering the Contract\\n\\n365\\n\\nWork Performance Information\\n\\nWork performance information concerns monitoring work results and examining the vendor’s deliverables. This includes monitoring their work results against the project management plan and making certain activities are performed correctly and in sequence. You’ll need to determine which deliverables are complete and which ones have not been completed to date. You’ll also need to consider the quality of the deliverables and the costs that have been incurred to date. Vendors request payment for the goods or services delivered in the form of seller invoices. Seller invoices should describe the work that was completed or the materials that were delivered and should include any supporting documentation necessary to describe what was delivered. The contract should state what type of supporting documentation is needed with the invoice.\\n\\nRemember that seller invoices are an element of the work performance infor- mation input to the Contract Administration process, not an output. Also, don’t confuse seller invoices with the payment system, which is a tool and technique of this process.\\n\\nAdministering Contracts with Tools and Techniques\\n\\nAdministering the contract requires several tools and techniques:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nContract change control system\\n\\nBuyer conducted performance review\\n\\nInspections and audits\\n\\nPerformance reporting\\n\\nPayment system\\n\\nClaims administration\\n\\nRecords management system\\n\\nInformation technology\\n\\nWe will look at each of these in the following sections.\\n\\nContract Change Control System\\n\\nMuch like the management plans found in the Planning processes, the contract change control system describes the processes needed to make contract changes. Since the contract is a legal document, changes to it require the agreement of all parties. A formal process must be estab- lished to process and authorize (or deny) changes. (Authorization levels are defined in the orga- nizational policies.)\\n\\nThe purpose of the contract change control system is to establish a formal process for sub- mitting change requests. It documents how to submit changes, establishes the approval process, and outlines authority levels. It includes a tracking system to number the change requests and\\n\\n3601.book  Page 366  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n366\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nrecord their status. The procedures for dispute resolution are spelled out in the change control system as well.\\n\\nThe change control system, along with all the management plan outputs, becomes part of the\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control process that we’ll discuss later in this chapter.\\n\\nBuyer Conducted Performance Reviews\\n\\nBuyer conducted performance reviews examine the seller’s performance on the contract to date. These reviews may be conducted at the end of the contract or at intervals during the contract period. Buyer reviews examine the contract terms and seller performance for elements such as these:\\n\\n(cid:2) Meeting project scope\\n\\n(cid:2) Meeting project quality\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nStaying within project budgets\\n\\n(cid:2) Meeting the project schedule\\n\\nThe performance reviews themselves may take the form of quality audits or inspections of\\n\\ndocuments as well as the work of the product itself. The point of the review is to determine where the seller is succeeding at meeting scope, quality, cost, and schedule issues, for example, or where they’re not measuring up. If the seller is not in compliance, action must be taken to either get them back into compliance or terminate the contract. The yardstick you’re using to measure their performance against is the contract SOW and the terms of the contract itself. When the RFP is included as part of the contract (which it usually is), you may also use it to determine contract compliance.\\n\\nInspections and Audits\\n\\nWe talked about quality audits as part of the Perform Quality Assurance process. The idea is the same here. The buyer, or some designated third party, will physically inspect the work of the seller and perform audits to determine if there are any deficiencies in the seller’s product or service.\\n\\nPerformance Reporting\\n\\nPerformance reporting is a large part of project management. This tool and technique entails providing your managers and stakeholders with information about the vendor’s progress meet- ing the contract objectives. This information is also part of the Performance Reporting process that we’ll discuss in depth later in this chapter.\\n\\nPayment Systems\\n\\nVendors submit seller invoices as an input to this process, and the payment system is the tool and technique used to issue payment. The organization may have a dedicated department, such as accounts payable, that handles vendor payments, or it might fall to the project manager. In either case, follow the policies and procedures the organization established regarding vendor payments.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 367  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nAdministering the Contract\\n\\n367\\n\\nClaims Administration\\n\\nClaims administration involves documenting, monitoring, and managing changes to the con- tract. Changes that cannot be agreed upon are called contested changes. Contested changes usu- ally involve a disagreement about the compensation to the vendor for implementing the change. You might believe the change is not significant enough to justify additional compensation, whereas the vendor believes they’ll lose money by implementing the change free of charge. Con- tested changes are also known as disputes, claims, or appeals. These can be settled directly between the parties themselves, through the court system, or by a process called arbitration. Arbitration involves bringing all parties to the table with a third, disinterested party who is not a participant in the contract to try to reach an agreement. The purpose of arbitration is to reach an agreement without having to go to court.\\n\\nRecords Management System\\n\\nI think it’s been a while since we’ve talked about documentation, but discussing records manage- ment systems reminds us of the importance of having an organized system for contract documenta- tion. A records management system involves not just documentation, but policies, control functions, and automated tools as part of the project management information system (which is both a part of the enterprise environmental factors and a tool and technique of several processes) used to manage project documents as well as contract documents. Records management systems typically index doc- uments for easy filing and retrieval.\\n\\nInformation Technology\\n\\nInformation technology, in this process, refers to the automated ways you can put some of the tools and techniques, outputs, processes, and so on to use. I don’t know about you, but I’ve reached a point where I can’t live without information technology. Having my e-mail, contacts, project documents, to-do lists, policy documents, and so on at my fingertips wherever I go is invaluable.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, using a project management software tool to help build the project schedule and allocate resources is much easier than developing all this by hand. Contract infor- mation and general project information and processes can be much more efficient when you use information technology to help you out.\\n\\nManaging Contract Outputs\\n\\nThe outputs to the Contract Administration process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nContract documentation\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process asset updates\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\n3601.book  Page 368  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n368\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nThese outputs relate to the tools and techniques just talked about and, in practice, work hand in hand with them. We’ve talked about recommended corrective actions and project manage- ment plan updates before and there’s nothing new to add here. The remaining outputs are either new or involve additional information you need to know.\\n\\nContract Documentation\\n\\nHere’s our favorite topic again. This output includes (but isn’t limited to) all of the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nContract\\n\\nPerformance information\\n\\n(cid:2) Warranties\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nFinancial information (like invoices and payment records)\\n\\nInspection and audit results\\n\\nSupporting schedules\\n\\nApproved and unapproved changes\\n\\nThe records management system we talked about earlier is the perfect place to keep all these\\n\\ndocuments.\\n\\nRequested Changes\\n\\nRequested contract changes are coordinated with the Direct and Manage Project Execution and Integrated Change Control processes so that any changes impacting the project itself are com- municated to the project team and appropriate actions are put into place to realign the objec- tives. This might also mean the project management plan itself will require changes. That requires you to jump back to the Planning process group to bring the project management plan up-to-date. Once the plan is up-to-date, the Direct and Manage Project Execution process may require changes as well to get the work of the project in line with the new plan. Remember that project management is an iterative process and it’s not unusual to revisit the Planning or Exe- cuting processes, particularly as changes are made or corrective actions are put into place.\\n\\nContract changes will not always impact the project management plan, however. For exam- ple, late delivery of key equipment probably would impact the project management plan, but changes in the vendor payment schedule probably would not. It’s important that you are kept abreast of any changes to the contract so that you can evaluate whether the project management plan needs adjusting.\\n\\nOrganizational Process Asset Updates\\n\\nOrganizational process assets consist of organizational policies, procedures, and so on. There are three elements of this output that relate to contracts:\\n\\nCorrespondence Correspondence is information that needs to be communicated in writing to either the seller or the buyer. Examples might be changes to the contract, clarification of con- tract terms, and notification of performance issues. You would also use correspondence to\\n\\n3601.book  Page 369  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nAdministering the Contract\\n\\n369\\n\\nnotify a vendor that you’re terminating the contract because performance is below expectations and is not satisfying the requirements of the contract.\\n\\nPayment schedules and requests Many times, contracts are written such that payment is made based on a predefined performance schedule. For example, perhaps the first payment is made after 25 percent of the product or service is completed. Or maybe the payment schedule is based on milestone completion. In any case, as the project manager, you will verify that the vendor’s work (or delivery) meets expectations before the payment is authorized. It’s almost always your responsibility as the project manager to verify that the terms of the contract to date have or have not been satisfied. Depending on your organizational policies, someone from the accounting or procurement department may request written notification from you that the vendor has com- pleted a milestone or made a delivery. Monitoring the work of the vendor is as important as monitoring the work of your team members.\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK states that the payment schedules and requests element pertains to pay- ment systems that are external to the project. For example, if the procurement department is responsible for paying the contractor, the payment schedule (which is one of the terms of the contract) is managed by them. The seller submits a payment request, an inspection or review of their performance is conducted to make certain the terms of the contract were fulfilled, and the payment is made. If the contract payments are being managed by the project team, this output is called payments.\\n\\nSeller performance evaluation Seller performance evaluation is a written record of the seller’s performance on the contract. It should include information about whether the seller successfully met contract dates, fulfilled the requirements of the contract and/or contract statement of work, whether the work was satisfactory and so on. Seller performance evaluations can be used as a basis for terminating the existing contract if performance is not satisfactory. They should also indicate whether this vendor should be allowed to bid on future work. Seller performance eval- uations can also be included as part of the qualified sellers lists.\\n\\nDon’t confuse payment systems (a tool and technique of Contract Administration) with payment schedules and requests (an output of Contract Administration). Pay- ment systems include reviews and authorization to issue the check. The payment schedules and request output is where the check gets sent to the seller.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nI recommend remembering the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the contracting pro- cesses, including Request Seller Responses, Select Sellers, and Contract Administration. Be certain you understand the purposes of these processes and don’t simply memorize their components.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 370  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n370\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nManaging Project Teams\\n\\nThe Manage Project Team process is concerned with tracking and reporting on the performance of individual team members. During this process, performance appraisals are prepared and con- ducted, issues are identified and resolved, and feedback is given to the team members. Some team behavior is also observed during this process, but the main focus here is on individuals and their performance.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nTake note that A Guide to the PMBOK states that one of the outcomes or results of the Manage Project Team process is an update to the staffing management plan. However, staffing man- agement plan updates are not listed as an output of this process.\\n\\nWe’ve seen all of the inputs to this process before:\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject staff assignments\\n\\nRoles and responsibilities\\n\\nProject organization charts\\n\\nStaffing management plan\\n\\nTeam performance assessment\\n\\n(cid:2) Work performance information\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPerformance reports\\n\\nTools and Techniques for Managing Teams\\n\\nMost of the tools and techniques for this process are new\\n\\n(cid:2) Observation and conversation\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject performance appraisal\\n\\nConflict management\\n\\nIssue log\\n\\nWe’ll take a closer look at each of these tools.\\n\\nObservation and Conversation\\n\\nObservation and conversation is another one of those obvious tools and techniques. In order to assess team member performance, you have to observe it. Hopefully, you’ve also learned how\\n\\n3601.book  Page 371  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Project Teams\\n\\n371\\n\\nimportant communication is to the success of the project. This includes communicating with your team members. I know project managers who are reticent to engage their teams in con- versation unless it’s official project business. I’ve even known project managers who instructed their administrative assistant to give a specific direction to another team member. Surely you don’t engage in these activities. It’s difficult to understand a team member’s attitude or view- point toward the project if you’re communicating through someone else. Establish an open door policy with your team members and live up to it. The benefits are so great that it’s worth a few minutes a day of chitchat to establish that feeling of trust and camaraderie.\\n\\nProject Performance Appraisal\\n\\nProject performance appraisals are typically annual or semiannual affairs where managers let their employees know what they think of their performance over the past year and rate them accordingly. These are usually manager-to-employee exchanges but can incorporate a 360- degree review, which takes in feedback from just about everyone the team member interacts with, including stakeholders, customers, project manager, peers, subordinates, and the delivery person if they have a significant amount of project interaction. I’m not a fan of 360-degree reviews because it makes most non-manager types uncomfortable. “I don’t want to rate my peer,” is a typical response. I also find 360-degree reviews are biased. At best you’ll get a response like, “Oh, Ken is great, just great. No problems, good guy,” or exactly the opposite if the person you’re speaking with doesn’t like the team member you’re asking about. Perfor- mance appraisal should be a bit more constructive than this. Nonetheless, understand the 360- degree concept for the exam.\\n\\nNo matter what type of appraisal is conducted, project managers should contribute to the performance appraisals of all project team members. You should be aware of potential loyalty issues when you’re working in a matrix organizational structure. The team member in this structure reports to both you (as the project manager) and a functional manager. If the project manager does not have an equal say, or at least some say, in the employee’s performance, it will cause the team member to be loyal to the functional manager and show little loyalty to the project or project manager. Managing these dual reporting relationships is often a critical suc- cess factor for the project and it is the project manager’s responsibility to assure that these rela- tionships are managed effectively.\\n\\nPerformance appraisal time is also a good time to explore training needs, to clarify roles and\\n\\nresponsibilities, to set goals for the future, and so on.\\n\\nConflict Management\\n\\nWe talked about conflict management in the last chapter. Here it’s important to note that, as in any situation, you’ll want to deal with conflict as soon as it arises. During the Manage Project Team process, most conflicts come about as a result of schedule issues, availability of resources (usually the lack of availability), or personal work habits. When project team members are hav- ing a conflict, address them first in private with the person who has the issue. Work in a direct and collaborative manner but be prepared to escalate the issue into a more formalized proce- dure (potentially even disciplinary action) if needed.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 372  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n372\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nIf conflicts exist between two of the team members, encourage resolution between them without intervention on your part. The best conflict resolution will come about when they can work out the issues between them. When that isn’t possible, you’ll have to step in and help resolve the matter.\\n\\nRemember that solid ground rules and established policies and procedures will help mitigate\\n\\nconflict before it arises.\\n\\nIssue Log\\n\\nThe issue log is a place to document the issues that keep the project team from meeting project goals. These can range from differences of opinion to newly surfaced responsibilities that need assigned to a project team member. Each issue should be recorded in the log along with the per- son responsible for resolving it. You should also note the date the resolution is needed.\\n\\nManaging Project Team Outputs\\n\\nThe outputs of the Manage Project Team process are the result of the conversations, perfor- mance appraisals, and conflict resolution we’ve talked about previously. There are five outputs of this process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions\\n\\nRecommended preventive actions\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process asset updates\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nRemember that the elements of these outputs pertain to human resources. For example, requested changes may come about as a result of a change in staffing, corrective actions may come about because of disciplinary actions or training needs, and preventive actions may be needed to reduce the impact of potential human resource issues. Any of these actions may cause changes to the staffing management plan which means the project management plan should also be updated.\\n\\nThe organizational process asset updates output has two components: input to organiza- tional performance appraisals and lessons learned documentation. Input to organizational per- formance appraisals comes from team members with significant interactions with the project and each other.\\n\\nLessons learned encompasses everything you’ve learned about the human resources aspect during this project, including documentation that can be used as templates on future projects (such as org charts and position descriptions), techniques used to resolve conflict, the types of conflict that came up during the project, ground rules, when and how virtual teams were used on the project and the procedures associated with them, special skills needed during the project that weren’t known about during the Planning processes, and the issues log.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 373  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nEstablishing Performance Measurements\\n\\n373\\n\\nManaging Stakeholders\\n\\nIn my experience, managing stakeholders is much more difficult than managing project team members. Stakeholders are often managers or directors in the organization who may be higher in the food chain than the project manager and aren’t afraid to let you know it. Having said that, you can manage stakeholders and it’s done using communication.\\n\\nIf you need a refresher or on the definition and role of stakeholders, please see Chapter 1, “What Is a Project?”\\n\\nThe Manage Stakeholders process is about satisfying the needs of the stakeholders by man-\\n\\naging communications with them, resolving issues, and improving project performance by implementing requested changes.\\n\\nStakeholders need lots of communication in every form you can provide. If you are actively engaged with your stakeholders and interacting with them, providing project status, and resolving issues, your chances of a successful project are much greater than if you don’t do these things.\\n\\nThe inputs of this process are the communications management plan and organizational pro- cess assets. We’ve seen both of these before. The tools and techniques include communication methods and issue logs. Keep in mind that face-to-face communications are the most effective with stakeholders. The issue log in this process is more like an action item log where you record the actions needed to resolve stakeholder concerns and project issues they raise. As with the issue log in the Manage Project Team process, you’ll assign a responsible party and a due date for resolution.\\n\\nThe outputs of the Manage Stakeholder process are resolved issues, approved change requests, approved corrective actions, organizational process assets updates, and project man- agement plan updates. Resolved issues are logged in the issues log.\\n\\nEstablishing Performance\\n\\nMeasurements\\n\\nAs mentioned, the Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrates on monitoring and measuring project performance to identify variances from the project plan. Performance Reporting is the process where the collection of baseline data occurs and is documented and reported. Performance Reporting is part of the Communications Management knowledge area, as is the Manage Stakeholders process. Thus, it involves collecting information regarding project progress and project accomplishments and reporting it to the stakeholders. This infor- mation may also be reported to project team members, the management team, and other inter- ested parties. Reporting might include information concerning project quality, costs, scope, project schedules, procurement, and risk.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 374  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n374\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nPerformance Reporting Inputs\\n\\nWe’ve examined all the inputs to the Performance Reporting process. They are listed here:\\n\\n(cid:2) Work performance information\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPerformance measurements\\n\\nForecasted completion\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality control measurements\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\nOne thing I should note about these inputs is that the project management plan contains the project management baseline data (typically cost, schedule, and scope factors), which you’ll use to monitor and compare results. Deviations from this data are reported to management. Per- formance measures are taken primarily during the Cost Control, Schedule Control, and Perform Quality Control processes, which we’ll look at in the next chapter.\\n\\nPerformance Reporting Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of this process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nInformation presentation tools\\n\\nPerformance information gathering and compilation\\n\\nStatus review meetings\\n\\nTime reporting systems\\n\\nCost reporting systems\\n\\nInformation Presentation Tools\\n\\nInformation presentation tools include automated tools like spreadsheet and presentation soft- ware that help you create presentable reports and information regarding the progress and status of the project for stakeholder review.\\n\\nPerformance Information Gathering and Compilation\\n\\nIf you and your team members have been diligently documenting your project’s performance, you need to gather all that information and keep it in one place. Performance information gathering and compilation can occur manually, as in everyone turns in hard copy reports to the project man- ager or other designated person, or you can gather information automatically from project man- agement software systems, databases, or other systems. The important thing is the documentation should be kept in one place and be easily accessible to anyone who needs it.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 375  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nEstablishing Performance Measurements\\n\\n375\\n\\nStatus Review Meetings\\n\\nStatus review meetings are important functions during the course of the project. (We introduced status review meetings with the Information Distribution Process in the last chapter.) The pur- pose of the status meeting is to provide updated information regarding the progress of the project. These are not show-and-tell meetings. If you have a prototype to demo, set up a differ- ent time to do that. Status meetings are meant to exchange information and provide project updates. They are a way to formally exchange project information. I’ve worked on projects where it’s not unusual to have three or four status meetings conducted for different audiences. They can occur between the project team and project manager, the project manager and stake- holders, the project manager and users or customers, the project manager and the management team, and so on.\\n\\nNotice that the project manager is always included in status review meetings. Take care that you don’t overburden yourself with meetings that aren’t necessary or could be combined with other meetings. Any more than three or four status meetings is unwieldy.\\n\\nRegular, timely status meetings prevent surprises down the road because you are keeping stakeholders and customers informed of what’s happening. Team status meetings alert the project manager to potential risk events and provide the opportunity to discover and manage problems before they get to the uncontrollable stage.\\n\\nThe project manager is usually the expediter of the status meeting. As such, it’s your job to use status meetings wisely. Don’t waste your team’s time or stakeholders’ time either. Notify attendees in writing of the meeting time and place. Publish an agenda prior to the meeting and stick to the agenda during the meeting. Every so often, summarize what’s been discussed during the meeting. Don’t let side discussions lead you down rabbit trails, and keep irrelevant conver- sations to a minimum. It’s also good to publish status meeting notes at the conclusion of the meeting, especially if any action items resulted from the meeting. This will give you a document trail and serves as a reminder to the meeting participants of what actions need to be resolved and who is responsible for the action item.\\n\\nIt’s important that project team members are honest with the project manager and that the project manager is in turn honest about what they report. A few years ago, a department in my agency took on a project of gargantuan proportions and unfortunately didn’t employ good project management techniques. One of the biggest problems with this project was that the project manager did not listen to their highly skilled project team members. The team members warned of problems and setbacks, but the project manager didn’t want to hear of it. The project man- ager took their reports to be of the “Chicken Little” ilk and refused to believe the sky was fall- ing. Unfortunately, the sky was falling! The project manager, because they didn’t believe it, refused to report the true status of the project to the stakeholders and oversight committees. Millions of dollars were wasted on a project that was doomed for failure, while the project man- ager continued to report that the project was on time and activities were completed when in fact they were not.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 376  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n376\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nThere are hundreds of project stories like this, and I’ll bet you’ve got one or two from your experiences as well. Don’t let your project become the next bad example. Above all, be honest in your reporting. No one likes bad news, but bad news delivered too late along with millions of dollars wasted is a guaranteed career showstopper.\\n\\nTime and Cost Reporting Systems\\n\\nTime and cost reporting systems are used to, obviously, record time and cost information about the project. Most specifically, these systems will report the time and cost that’s been expended on the project to date.\\n\\nPerformance Reporting Outputs\\n\\nThere are several outputs to the Performance Reporting process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPerformance reports\\n\\nForecasts\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets updates\\n\\nPerformance reports is the primary output of this process. It’s here that performance infor- mation is gathered, documented, and reported to the stakeholders as outlined in the communi- cation management plan. These reports might take many forms, including S curves (cost baselines are recorded this way), bar charts, tables, and histograms. Earned value information is often reported during this process as well. We’ll examine this topic in the next chapter during the discussion of the Cost Control process.\\n\\nIn the next chapter we’ll explore the main change control processes and the measurement tools you’ll use to provide the variance measurements that are gathered and reported to the stakeholder during the Performance Reporting process.\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nYour regularly scheduled status meeting is coming up. Let’s see how it’s progressing.\\n\\n“Thank you all for coming,” you begin. You note those stakeholders who are present and pass out the agendas. “First, we have a contract update. Jake, would you give us the update please?”\\n\\n“Gomez Construction has submitted a seller payment request for the work completed through November 30. Shelly in our contract management office manages the payment system and handles all payment requests. She’ll get a check cut and out to Gomez by the end of this month. They are doing an outstanding job as always. As you know, I’ve also hired an independent inspector, aside from the city and county types, so that we make sure we’re up to code before the city types get there. I don’t want to get caught in that trap and end up delaying the project because we can’t get the city inspector back out to reinspect quickly enough.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 377  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nEstablishing Performance Measurements\\n\\n377\\n\\n“Thank you, Jake. Any problems with those inspections so far?”\\n\\nJake clears his throat. “It turned out to be a good move because the contractor did find some things that we were able to correct before bringing out the official inspectors.”\\n\\n“Ricardo, do you have a contract update for us today?”\\n\\n“Yes. The contract management office used a fixed price contract on the hardware and IT sup- plies order. That contract is just now making its way through the sign-off processes. My group will manage the quality control and testing once all this equipment arrives.”\\n\\n“Jill, can you give us the update on the store?” you ask.\\n\\n“I’ve ordered all the retail products, the cookware line, and have lined up the chef demos. The costs for the new gourmet supplier we’re using are higher than our original vendor. This impacts ongoing operations, but the hit to the project budget is minimal. I should also mention that a change request was submitted.\\n\\nYou point everyone’s attention to the issues list. “Last meeting I reported that Gomez had an important crew member out on a family emergency. Gomez was able to replace the team mem- ber with no impact to the schedule. Next issue was the T1 connection—I reported that Ricardo was not receiving phone calls back. Good news—that issue has been cleared, the date has been set, and we can close this issue. Are there any new issues to be added this week?”\\n\\nOne of the stakeholders from the marketing department speaks up, “I need someone from the project team to work with me on the website announcement. I haven’t heard anything and I don’t want to cut this so close that we put up something sub-par on the website. The 50th anni- versary deserves a little splash.”\\n\\n“Okay,” you reply. “I’ll set up a meeting with you to get more information and then we’ll deter- mine who is the best fit. I’ve noted we need to assign someone to this activity in the issues log. On another note, I have one more issue to report. Unfortunately, we lost a valuable team mem- ber last week. I don’t want to go into all the details here but this employee violated our Internet acceptable use policy. This person was placed on disciplinary action on this very issue once before. This will cause an impact to the project schedule because his activities were on the crit- ical path. I’ve already interviewed two internal candidates who’ve expressed interest in work- ing on the project. I believe either one would work out nicely. However, there is some ramp-up time needed.\\n\\n“What’s the forecast?” Dirk asks. “Are we on track for meeting the grand opening date given all these issues?\\n\\n“I’ll have performance figures for you at the next status meeting and I have some ideas on how we can make up this time other ways so that we still meet the date.”\\n\\nYou thank everyone for coming and remind them of the next meeting time.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 378  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n378\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nProject Case Study Checklist\\n\\nContract Administration\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nContract documentation\\n\\nSeller invoices\\n\\nPayment systems\\n\\nRecords management system\\n\\nPerform Quality Assurance\\n\\nQuality audits\\n\\n(cid:2) Making certain the project will meet and satisfy the quality standards of the project\\n\\nManage Project Team\\n\\nObservation and conversation\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions\\n\\nConflict management\\n\\nIssue log\\n\\nManage Stakeholders\\n\\nCommunications methods\\n\\nIssue log\\n\\nResolved issues\\n\\nPerformance Reporting\\n\\nPerformance reports (status meetings)\\n\\nForecasts\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n3601.book  Page 379  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n379\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis chapter finished up the Executing process group and looked at the first process in the Mon- itoring and Controlling process group. We discussed Request Seller Responses, Select Sellers, Contract Administration, and Perform Quality Assurance from the Executing process group. We also covered several processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group including Monitor and Control project Work, Contract Administration, Manage Project Team, Manage Stakeholders, and Performance Reporting. Request Seller Responses involves obtaining bids and responses from vendors. The tools and techniques of this process include bidder confer- ences, advertising, and develop qualified sellers list.\\n\\nSelect Sellers involves receiving bids or proposals. In this process, the selection committee will use evaluation criteria to prioritize the bids and proposals and the outcome is that a seller (or sellers) is selected and contracts awarded.\\n\\nDuring the Perform Quality Assurance process, quality audits are performed to ensure that\\n\\nthe project will meet and satisfy the project’s quality standards set out in the quality plan.\\n\\nThe Monitor and Control Project Work project concerns monitoring all the project process groups, collecting data, measuring results, reporting on performance information, and taking corrective action to keep the project in scope and on schedule.\\n\\nContract Administration is the process where you’ll monitor the vendor’s performance and ensure that all the requirements of the contract are met. If there is more than one vendor work- ing on the project, Contract Administration entails coordinating the interfaces among all the vendors as well as administering each of the contracts.\\n\\nContracts have cycles of their own, much like projects. Phases of the contracting life cycle include requirement, requisition, solicitation, and award. Changes to the contract are managed with change requests.\\n\\nChanges that cannot be agreed upon are called contested changes. These take the form of dis- putes, claims, or appeals. They might be settled among the parties directly, through a court of law, or through arbitration.\\n\\nRequest Seller Responses and Select Sellers belong to the Executing process group and the Contract Administration belongs to the Monitoring and Controlling process group. In practice, you’ll generally perform Request Seller Responses, Select Sellers, and Contract Administration in that order.\\n\\nManage Project Teams involves tracking and reporting on project team member perfor- mance. Performance appraisals are performed during this process and feedback is provided to the team members.\\n\\nThe Manage Stakeholders process concerns making certain communication needs of the stakeholders are met, managing any issues stakeholders might raise, and implementing change requests.\\n\\nThe last process in this chapter, Performance Reporting, is one of the ways stakeholders (and others) are kept informed of project progress. Performance Reporting includes tools and tech- niques like information presentation tools and status reports to report performance, requested changes, forecast future project performance, and update organizational process assets.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 380  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n380\\n\\nChapter 9 (cid:2) Measuring and Controlling Project Performance\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to describe the difference between the Request Seller Responses process and the Select Sellers process. Request Seller Responses obtains bids and proposals from vendors. Select Sell- ers is the receipt of bids and proposals and the selection of a vendor.\\n\\nBe able to name the tools and techniques of the Select Sellers process. The tools and tech- niques of the Select Sellers process are weighting systems, independent estimates, screening sys- tems, contract negotiation, seller rating systems, expert judgment, and proposal evaluation techniques.\\n\\nBe able to describe the purpose of the Perform Quality Assurance process. The Perform Quality Assurance process is concerned with making certain the project will meet and satisfy the quality standards of the project.\\n\\nBe able to describe the purpose of the Monitor and Control Project Work process. Monitor and Control Project Work monitors the project process groups including Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing. This process reports and compares project results with the project man- agement plan, monitors approved change requests, and analyzes, documents, and records project information.\\n\\nBe able to name the contracting life cycle stages. Contracting life cycles include requirement, requisition, solicitation, and award.\\n\\nBe able to name the tools and techniques of the Manage Project Team process. The tools and techniques of Manage Project Team are observation and conversation, project performance appraisal, conflict management, and issue log.\\n\\nBe able to describe the purpose of the Manage Stakeholders process Manage Stakeholders concerns satisfying the needs of the stakeholders by managing communications with them.\\n\\nBe able to define the purpose of the Performance Reporting process. The Performance Reporting process collects and reports information regarding project progress and project accomplishments. The technique used often to report on project performance is earned value analysis.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 381  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\n381\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

You are a project manager for Dakota Software Consulting Services. You’re working with a\\n\\nmajor retailer that offers its products through mail-order catalogs.

This chapter will finish up the remaining pro- cesses in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.\\n\\nPerformance reports, which are an output of the Performance Reporting process, serve as an input to some of the Monitoring and Controlling processes we’ll talk about in this chapter. Per- formance reports are used during the Monitoring and Controlling processes, along with tools and techniques, to measure project performance. These measurements and control tools allow the project manager to take corrective action during the Monitoring and Controlling processes to remedy wayward project results and realign future project results with the project manage- ment plan.\\n\\nWe’ll cover several processes in this chapter, including Integrated Change Control, Cost\\n\\nControl, Schedule Control, and Risk Monitoring and Control.\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control lays the foundation for all of the change control processes. We’ll\\n\\nspend time during this process to explain how change control works. The Cost Control and Schedule Control processes are very similar to Integrated Change Control. Remember when you’re reading these sections that the information from the Integrated Change Control process applies to these areas as well. Risk Monitoring and Control monitors the project for risks and monitors the risk response plans that have been put into action or may need to be put into action. You’ve learned a lot about project management by this point and have just a few more things\\n\\nto add to your study list. Keep up the good work. You’re getting closer to exam day.\\n\\nManaging Integrated Change Control\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control\\n\\nprocess serves as an overseer, so to speak, of the Monitoring\\n\\nThe and Controlling processes. This is where the project’s change control process is established. Changes, updates, and corrective actions are common outputs across all the Monitoring and Controlling processes. (And don’t forget that requested change requests are also an output of the Direct and Manage Project Plan Execution process, which is an Executing process.) These outputs often generate change requests that are managed through this process.\\n\\nWe’ve seen all of the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process before. There isn’t any new information to add to these. However, there are likely exam questions on several topics that involve change and the Integrated Change Control process. Configuration manage- ment, for example, isn’t listed as a tool and technique of this process, but you really can’t per- form Integrated Change Control without it. We’ll discuss this shortly. First, let’s look at change, what it is, and how it comes about.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 393  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Integrated Change Control\\n\\n393\\n\\nChanges come about on projects for many reasons. It’s the project manager’s responsibility to manage these changes and see to it that organizational policies regarding changes are imple- mented. Changes don’t necessarily mean negative consequences. Changes can produce positive results as well. It’s important that you manage this process carefully, because too many changes—even one significant change—will impact cost, schedule, scope, and/or quality. Once a change request has been submitted, you’ve got some decisions to make. Ask yourself questions such as, Should the change be implemented? If so, what’s the cost to the project in terms of project constraints: cost, time, scope, and quality? Will the benefits gained by making the change increase or decrease the chances of project completion?\\n\\nJust because a change is requested doesn’t mean you have to implement it. You’ll always want to discover the reasons for the change and determine if they’re justifiable, and you’ll want to know the cost of the change. Remember that cost can take the form of increased time. Let’s say the change you’re considering increases the schedule completion date. That means you’ll need human resources longer than expected. If you’ve leased equipment or project resources for the team members to use during the course of the project, a later completion date means your team needs the leased equipment for a longer period of time. All this translates to increased costs. Time equals money, as the saying goes, so manage time changes wisely and dig deep to find the impacts that time changes might make on the budget.\\n\\nHow Change Occurs\\n\\nAs the project progresses, the stakeholders or customers may request a change directly. Team members might also recommend changes as the project progresses. For example, once the project is under way, they may discover more efficient ways of performing tasks or producing the product of the project and recommend changes to accommodate the new efficiencies. Changes may also come about as a result of mistakes that were made earlier in the project (in the Planning or in the Executing processes. Hopefully, you’ve applied all the great practices and techniques we’ve talked about to date and didn’t experience many of these.\\n\\nChanges to the project may occur indirectly as a result of contingency plans, other changes, or team members performing favors for the stakeholders by making that one little change with- out telling anyone about it. Many times, the project manager is the last to know about changes like this one. There’s a fine line here because you don’t want to discourage good working rela- tionships between team members and stakeholders, yet at the same time, you want to ensure that all changes come through the change control process. If a dozen little changes slip through like this, your project scope suddenly exits stage left.\\n\\nChange Control Concerns\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control, according to the following:\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK,\\n\\nis primarily concerned with\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nInfluencing the factors that cause change and reaching agreement on their resulting change requests\\n\\nDetermining that change is needed or has happened\\n\\n3601.book  Page 394  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n394\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2)\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nManaging approved changes\\n\\nUpdating the requirements that impact scope, quality, schedule, and budgets based on approved changes\\n\\nDocumenting requested changes and their impacts\\n\\nFactors that may cause change include project constraints, stakeholder requests, team mem- ber recommendations, vendor issues, and many others. You’ll want to understand the factors that are influencing or bringing about change and how a proposed change may impact the project if implemented. Performance measures and corrective actions may dictate that a project change is needed as well.\\n\\nModifications to the project are submitted in the form of change requests and managed through the change control process. Obviously, you’ll want to imple- ment those changes that are most beneficial to the project. We’ll talk more about change requests later in this chapter.\\n\\nperformance measurement baseline.\\n\\nManaging changes may involve making changes to the project scope, schedule, or cost baseline, This baseline may also involve quality or also known as the technical elements. The performance measurement baseline is the approved project management plan that describes the work of the project. This is used through Executing and Monitoring and Controlling to measure project performance and determine deviations from the plan. It’s your responsibility to maintain the reliability of the performance measurement baselines. If changes are not appropriately reflected in the baselines, they become meaningless. Changes that impact a pre- vious project management process will require updates to those processes, which might mean additional passes through the appropriate Planning and Executing processes.\\n\\nThe management plans created during the Planning process group should reflect the changes as well, which may require updates to the project management plan or the project scope state- ment. This requires a close eye on coordination among all the processes that are impacted. For example, changes may require updates to risk response alternatives, schedule, cost, resource requirements, or other elements. Changes that impact product scope always require an update to the project scope.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nManaging changes involves maintaining accurate and reliable performance measurement baselines, coordinating all processes impacted as a result of the change, including revisiting Planning and Executing processes where needed and updating project scope to reflect any changes in product scope.\\n\\nI caution you to not change baselines at the drop of a hat. Examine the changes, their justi-\\n\\nfication, and their impacts thoroughly before making changes to the baselines.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 395  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Integrated Change Control\\n\\n395\\n\\nConfiguration Management\\n\\nis generally a subset of the project management information system.\\n\\nConfiguration management It describes the process for submitting change requests and includes processes for tracking the changes and their disposition, processes for defining the approval levels for approving and deny- ing changes, and a process for authorizing the changes.

It’s about accounting for the status of the changes by documenting and storing the configuration information needed to effectively manage the product information.\\n\\nVerification and audits are performed as part of config- Configuration verification and auditing uration management to determine if the performance and functional requirements have been met.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nUnderstand for the exam that configuration management involves identifying the physical characteristics of the product of the project (or of the individual components of the product), controlling changes to those characteristics, and documenting changes to verify that require- ments are met. It also includes the change management system and documents the process for requesting, tracking, and determining if change requests should be approved or denied.\\n\\nChange Control System\\n\\nIf you were to allow changes to occur to the project whenever requested, you would probably never complete the project. Stakeholders, the customer, and end users would continually change the project requirements if given the opportunity to do so. That’s why careful planning and scope definition are important in the beginning of the project. It’s your job as project manager to drive out all the compelling needs and requirements of the project during the Planning pro- cess so that important requirements aren’t suddenly “remembered” halfway through the project. However, we’re all human, and sometimes things are not known, weren’t thought about, or simply weren’t discovered until a certain point during the project. Stakeholders will probably start thinking in a direction they weren’t considering during the Planning process, and comes into play. new requirements will come to light. This is where the\\n\\nchange control system\\n\\n3601.book  Page 396  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n396\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2)\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nThe Purpose of the Change Control System\\n\\nChange control systems are documented procedures that describe how to submit change requests, how to manage change requests, and the management impacts of the changes as they pertain to project performance. They are usually subsystems of the configuration management system. They can include preprinted change request forms that provide a place to record general project information such as the name and project number, the date, and the details regarding the change request.\\n\\nThe change control system also tracks the status of change requests, including their approval status. Not all change requests will receive approval to be implemented. Those changes that are not approved are also tracked and filed in the project notebook for future reference.\\n\\nThe change control system may define the level of authority needed to approve changes if it wasn’t previously defined in the configuration management system. Some change requests could receive approval based on the project manager’s decision; others may need more formal approval or more levels of approval such as the project sponsor, executive management, and so on.\\n\\nProcedures should be defined that detail how emergency changes are approved as well. For example, you and your team might be putting in some weekend hours and are close to the com- pletion of a deliverable when you discover that thing one will not talk to thing two no matter what you do. The team brainstorms and comes up with a brilliant solution that requires a change request. Do you stop work right then and wait until the change control board or com- mittee can meet sometime next week and make a decision, or do you—the project manager— make the decision to go forward with this solution and explain the change to the appropriate parties later? That answer depends on the change procedures you have in place to handle situ- ations like this and the authority you have to make emergency changes as outlined in the change control system.\\n\\nMany organizations have formal change control or change request systems in place. If that’s the case, you can easily adopt those procedures and use the existing system to manage project change. But if no procedures exist, you’ll have to define them.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe change control system and configuration management system together identify, docu- ment, and control the changes to the performance baseline.\\n\\nRequirements for Change\\n\\nThere are two things you should require at the beginning of all projects regarding change. First, require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure no confusion exists regarding what’s requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change. Keep in mind that you will get verbal change requests as well.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 397  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Integrated Change Control\\n\\n397\\n\\nChange requests may be verbal or written, but it’s good practice to require them in writing.\\n\\nSecond, all change requests must come through the formal change control system. Make sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the project man- ager knowing about it. Also make certain your stakeholders understand that this can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and isn’t good change management practice. Encourage them from the beginning of the project to use the formal procedures laid out in the change control system to request changes.\\n\\nChange Control Board\\n\\nconfiguration control board (CCB)\\n\\nIn some organizations, a is established to review all change requests. The board is given the authority to approve or deny change requests as defined by the organization. It’s important that its authority is clearly defined and that separate procedures exist for emergency changes. The CCB may meet only once a week, once every other week, or even once a month, depending on the project. When emergencies arise, the preestablished procedures allow the project manager to implement the change on the spot. This will always require a follow-up with the CCB and the completion of a formal change request even though it’s after the fact.\\n\\nCCB members may include stakeholders, managers, project team members, and others who may not have any connection to the project at hand. Some organizations have permanent CCBs that are staffed by full-time employees dedicated to managing change for the entire organiza- tion, not just project change. You may want to consider establishing a CCB for your project if the organization does not have one.\\n\\nSome organizations use other types of review boards that have the same responsibilities as\\n\\nthe CCB. Some other names you might see are technical assessment board (TAB), technical review board (TRB), engineering review board (ERB), and change control board (CCB).\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control Inputs\\n\\nThe inputs to the Integrated Change Control process are similar to its outputs. The inputs are “requested” or “recommended,” while the outputs are “approved.” For example, requested changes are inputs and approved or rejected change requests are outputs; recommended cor- rective actions are inputs and approved corrective actions are outputs. The inputs for the Inte- grated Change Control process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended preventive actions\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions\\n\\nRecommended defect repair\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\n3601.book  Page 398  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n398\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2)\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nRemember that the project management plan includes all the documents together that make\\n\\nup that plan—the project schedule, budget, scope statement, and so on.\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control Tools and Techniques\\n\\nWe’ve seen all the tools and techniques for Integrated Change Control in previous processes:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management methodology\\n\\nProject management information system\\n\\nExpert judgment\\n\\nThe project management methodology tool and technique really comes in handy with this\\n\\nprocess because part of this methodology defines how you’ll perform change control. The project management information system is used to document and track change information and expert judgment helps determine the disposition of change requests.\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control Outputs\\n\\nThe outputs of the Integrated Change Control process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\nRejected change requests\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nProject scope management plan updates\\n\\nApproved corrective actions\\n\\nApproved preventive actions\\n\\nApproved defect repair\\n\\nValidated defect repair\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\nProject management plan updates are typically required as a result of an approved change or\\n\\ncorrective action. These changes are noted in the change control system or the configuration management system and stakeholders are informed at the status meetings of the changes that have occurred, their impacts, and where the description of the changes can be found.\\n\\nAll of the actions taken in the Integrated Change Control process (whether implemented or not) should be documented. You should also record the reason for the variance. In other words, how did this particular change request come about? How did it change the original project man- agement plan? Is this something you could or should have known about in the Planning processes? The corrective action taken and the justification for choosing that particular corrective action should be noted as part of lessons learned also. You can use the information you capture here in your configuration management system as lessons learned for future projects. When you take on a new project, it’s a good idea to review the lessons learned of similar projects so that you can plan appropriately and avoid, where possible, the variances that occurred in the first project.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 399  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Cost Changes\\n\\n399\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\n“Recommended” corrective action is an output of several of the change control processes, including Scope Change Control, Schedule Control, Cost Control, Risk Monitoring and Control, and Perform Quality Control. “Approved” corrective action is an output of the Integrated Change Control process. Remember that Integrated Change Control is where all change requests are processed and either approved or denied. Also note that corrective action is an output of the Monitoring and Controlling processes and an input to the Executing processes.\\n\\nManaging Cost Changes\\n\\nCost Control\\n\\nThe process manages changes to project costs as outlined in the cost management plan. It’s concerned with monitoring project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from getting included in the cost baseline. This means you’re also using Cost Control to assure that the project budget isn’t exceeded (resulting in cost overruns) and that changes to the budget are man- aged and agreed to, to assure that unapproved changes are not made, to inform stakeholders of changes, and to actively manage expected cost overruns so they stay within acceptable limits.\\n\\nCost Control Inputs\\n\\nThe Cost Control process includes the following inputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCost baseline\\n\\nProject funding requirements\\n\\nPerformance reports\\n\\nWork performance information\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nThese inputs are examined using the tools and techniques of this process to determine if revised cost estimates or budget updates are required.

The existing accounting system lives on a mainframe, and some of the programs used to process data on this system are over 15 years old. Your company decided to hire a contract software services firm to write a thin-client, browser-based version of the accounting system so that the mainframe programs could be retired.\\n\\nThe project is in the Monitoring and Controlling process group and the contract project man- ager keeps reporting that everything is okay and on schedule. When you asked him detailed questions and requested performance data, the project manager patted you on the back and said, “Don’t worry, I’ve got everything under control.”\\n\\nYou are a little worried because some of the key project team members have come to you con- fidentially to inform you of the progress of the project.\\n\\nAfter further investigation, you discover that the project manager changed the database from SQL to Oracle midway through the project and didn’t tell anyone except the project team. The project scope stated specifically that project development required a SQL database. The change in database products changed the project scope and product scope without letting the stakeholders know.\\n\\nThis change has caused schedule delays because the project team members have told you they need training in the new database development tools before they can proceed. Additionally, many of the programs have already been written to interface with SQL, not Oracle, and will have to be modified. To add insult to injury, the database switch will impact the project budget in two ways. First, purchasing the Oracle database involves substantially more money than the SQL database and it requires the purchase of new development tools for the programming team. Second, several members of the programming staff will have to attend multiple training sessions on the new database product to fully integrate the programs and system. Training is currently running $2,200 per session per person.\\n\\nSince you’re a key stakeholder, you decide to bring the information you’ve discovered out into the open at the next project status meeting. Additionally, you plan to meet with the project sponsor and the procurement department to determine what alternatives you have to request that the contracting firm replace the current project manager with a new project manager. This may cause further setback to the project, but the project management plan and project sched- ule will require updates anyway as a result of the existing project manager’s decisions. You also determine to document all that’s happened as a lesson learned and to set up a change con- trol process to prevent this from happening in the future.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 401  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Cost Changes\\n\\n401\\n\\nCost Change Control System\\n\\nThe cost change control system describes how changes are submitted, approved, and tracked and is closely linked with the integrated change control system. Cost variances (both positive and negative) are calculated using the performance measurement analysis tool (specifically earned value techniques). We’ll look at this next.\\n\\nPerformance Measurement Analysis\\n\\nPerformance measurement analysis is accomplished using a technique called Simply stated, EVT compares what you got to what you spent. nique (EVT).\\n\\nearned value tech\\n\\n\\n\\nThe EVT continuously monitors the planned value, earned value, and actual costs expended to produce the work of the project (we’ll cover the definition of these terms shortly). When vari- ances that result in cost changes are discovered (including schedule variances and cost vari- ances), those changes are managed using the cost change control system. The primary function of this analysis technique is to determine and document the cause of the variance, to determine the impact of the variance (we’ll do this with the EVT formulas shortly), and to determine if a corrective action should be implemented as a result.\\n\\nEVT looks at schedule, cost, and scope project measurements together and compares them\\n\\nto the actual work completed to date. It is the most often used performance measurement method. To perform the EVT calculations, you need to first gather the three measurements we mentioned earlier: the planned value (PV), actual cost (AC), and earned value (EV). Let’s look at a definition of each of these before we dive into the actual calculations.\\n\\nIf you do any research on your own regarding these values, you may come across acronyms that are different than what you see here. I’ve included their alternate names and acronyms at the end of each description. I recommend you memorize planned value (PV), actual cost (AC), and earned value (EV) and make certain you understand the meaning of each before progressing.\\n\\nPlanned value The planned value (PV) is the cost of work that’s been budgeted for a schedule activity or WBS component to be completed during a given time period. These budgets are estab- lished during the Planning processes. PV is also called budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS).\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nRemember to read exam questions carefully. PV might mean present value (like we talked about in Chapter 2) or planned value as defined here.\\n\\nActual cost Actual cost (AC) is the cost of completing the work (a schedule activity or WBS component) in a given time period. Actual costs may include direct and indirect costs but must correspond to what was budgeted for the activity. If the budgeted amount did not include indirect\\n\\n3601.book  Page 402  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n402\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\ncosts, do not include them here. Later you’ll see how to compare this to PV to come up with vari- ance calculation results. AC is also called actual cost of work performed (ACWP)\\n\\nEarned value Earned value (EV) is the value of the work (schedule activity or WBS component) completed to date as it compares to the budgeted amount assigned to the work component. EV is also called budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP)\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nPV, AC, and EV are really easy to mix up. In their simplest forms, here’s what each means:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPV = The approved budget assigned to work to be completed during a given time period\\n\\nAC = Money that’s actually been expended to date (or during a given time period) for com- pleted work\\n\\nEV = The value of the work completed to date compared to the budget\\n\\nAccording to our earlier definition, EV is the sum of the cumulative budgeted costs for com-\\n\\npleted work for all activities that have been accomplished as of the measurement date. For example, if your total budget is $1,000 and 50 percent of the work has been completed as of the measurement date, your EV would equal $500. The PV, AC, and EV measurements can be plot- ted graphically to show the variances between them. If there are no variances in the measure- ments, all the lines on the graph remain the same, which means the project is progressing as planned. Figure 10.1 shows an example that plots these three measurements.\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 0 . 1\\n\\nEarned value\\n\\nMeasurement\\n\\nDate\\n\\nPV\\n\\nSchedule\\n\\nVariance\\n\\nCost\\n\\nVariance\\n\\nEV\\n\\nAC\\n\\nDollars\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\nJan 1\\n\\nApr 1\\n\\nJul 1\\n\\nOct 1\\n\\n3601.book  Page 403  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Cost Changes\\n\\n403\\n\\nAll of these measurements include a cost component. Costs are displayed in an S curve because spending is minimal in the beginning of the project, picks up steam toward the middle, and then tapers off at the end of the project. This means your earned value measurements will also take on the S curve shape.\\n\\nNow you can calculate whether the project is progressing as planned using a variety of for- mulas discussed in the following sections. Use Figure 10.1 as your example for the formulas that follow. Figure 10.1 totals are as follows: PV = 400; EV = 375; AC = 325.\\n\\nCost Variance\\n\\nCost variance is one of the most popular variances that project managers use, and it tells you if costs are higher than budgeted (with a resulting negative number) or lower than budgeted (with a resulting positive number).\\n\\nThe cost variance (CV) is calculated as follows:\\n\\nCV = EV – AC\\n\\nLet’s calculate the CV using the numbers from Figure 10.1:\\n\\n50 = 375 – 325\\n\\nThe CV is positive, which means you’re spending less than what you planned as of July 1\\n\\n(which Figure 10.1 shows because AC is below EV).\\n\\nIf you come up with a negative number as the answer to this formula, it means that costs are\\n\\nhigher than what you’d planned as of July 1.\\n\\nSchedule Variance\\n\\nSchedule variance, also a popular variance, tells you if the schedule is ahead or behind what was planned for this period in time. The schedule variance (SV) is calculated as follows:\\n\\nSV = EV – PV\\n\\nLet’s plug in the numbers:\\n\\n–25 = 375 – 400\\n\\nThe resulting schedule variance is negative, which means you are behind schedule, or behind\\n\\nwhere you planned to be as of July 1.\\n\\nTogether, the CV and SV are known as efficiency indicators for the project.\\n\\nPerformance Indexes\\n\\nCost and schedule performance indexes are primarily used to calculate performance efficiencies. They’re often used in trend analysis to predict future performance. You’ll need to know the cal- culations and what the results mean. If your result in either formula is greater than 1, you’ve got better than expected performance. If the result is less than 1, you’ve got poor performance. If it equals 1, you’re right on target.\\n\\nThe cost performance index (CPI) is calculated this way:\\n\\nCPI = EV ÷ AC\\n\\nLet’s plug in the numbers and see where you stand.\\n\\n1.15 = 375 ÷ 325\\n\\n3601.book  Page 404  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n404\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nThis means cost performance is better than expected. You get an A+ on this assignment! Cumulative CPI (CPIC) is a commonly used calculation to predict project costs at the completion of the project. It also represents the cumulative CPI of the project at the point the measurement is taken. First, you need to sum the earned value calculations taken to date (EVC) and the actual costs to date (ACC). The formula looks just like the CPI formula only it uses the sums as follows:\\n\\nCPIC = EVC ÷ ACC\\n\\nThe difference between this and the CPI formula earlier is that the CPI formula is used for a single work component whereas the CPIC is calculated using the sum of all the costs of all the work components. Additionally, you may also use CPI to calculate the total cost of a work com- ponent like a deliverable for example. Let’s say you have a deliverable with 75 schedule activ- ities that need to be completed. You would total the EV and AC at the measurement date for all 75 schedule activities to determine the cost performance index for the deliverable.\\n\\nThe schedule performance index (SPI) is calculated this way:\\n\\nSPI = EV ÷ PV\\n\\nAgain, let’s see where you stand with this example:\\n\\n.94 = 375 ÷ 400\\n\\nUh oh, not so good. Schedule performance is not what you expected. Let’s not grade this one.\\n\\nForecasting\\n\\nForecasting uses the information you’ve gathered to date and estimates the future conditions or per- formance of the project based on what you know when the calculation is performed. Forecasts are based on work performance information (an output from the Executing process group). There are two types of forecasting techniques: estimate to complete and estimate at completion. Each has three variations. Both of these formulas use a new parameter we haven’t seen yet called budget at com- pletion (BAC). BAC is the sum of all the budget values established for all the work of the project.\\n\\nLet’s look at each of the techniques.\\n\\nEstimate to Complete\\n\\nEstimate to complete (ETC) tells you how much it will cost to complete all the work remaining for a schedule activity or WBS component or the project. There is one variation of ETC that doesn’t require a formula. It’s called ETC based on a new estimate. This is simply a revised esti- mate based on the performance of the resources to date. By examining how quickly or how pro- ductively the resources have been utilized so far, the project team can determine a noncalculated ETC by looking at the remaining work and determining a new estimate based on the compar- ison to past work. This ETC, according to A Guide to the PMBOK, is the most accurate and comprehensive ETC calculation.\\n\\nThe two remaining ETC calculations use earned value data. These are quick to perform but not as accurate as the project team manually examining the remaining work and making a new estimate based on past performance.\\n\\nWhen you believe that future cost variances will be similar to the types of variances you’ve\\n\\nseen to date, you’ll use this formula to calculate ETC:\\n\\nETC = (BAC – EVC) ÷ CPIC\\n\\n3601.book  Page 405  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Cost Changes\\n\\n405\\n\\nAssuming our EVC value is 725, CPIC value is 1.12, and BAC is 1000, let’s plug in the\\n\\nnumbers:\\n\\n245.5 = (1000 – 725) ÷ 1.12\\n\\nTherefore, at the measurement date (July 1), we need $245.50 to complete all the remaining work of this work component (or project if you’re using project totals) assuming variances in the future will be the same as they have been to date.\\n\\nWhen you believe that future cost variances will not be similar to the types of variances\\n\\nyou’ve seen to date, you’ll use this formula to calculate ETC:\\n\\nETC = (BAC – EVC)\\n\\nLet’s calculate our value:\\n\\n275 = (1000 – 725)\\n\\nIn this case, we need $275 to complete all the remaining work of this work component\\n\\nassuming variances in the future are different than they have been to date.\\n\\nEstimate at Completion\\n\\nThere are only a few calculations remaining that will help you finish up your analysis of project progress. Estimate at completion (EAC) estimates (or forecasts) the expected total cost of a work component, schedule activity, or the project at its completion. This is the probable final value for the work component (or project).\\n\\nThere are three ways to calculate EAC. The first one is EAC using a new estimate. This assumes that the original assumptions used when estimating were flawed or that changes have occurred that have changed the original estimates. ETC in this calculation is provided by the performing organization (the ETC based on a new estimate figure.) The formula looks like this:\\n\\nEAC = ACC + ETC\\n\\nAssuming our ACC is 650 and ETC is 275, we get this:\\n\\n925 = 650 + 275\\n\\nThis means the expected total value of the project $925. The last two methods for calculating EAC are the most common. The first EAC uses CPIC\\n\\nand the second calculates EAC using remaining budget. Let’s look at EAC using CPIC first.\\n\\nEAC using CPIC is the second way to perform an ETC calculation. This formula is the ACC\\n\\nplus ETC (when variances are typical). It looks like this:\\n\\nEAC = ACC + ((BAC – EV) ÷ CPIC)\\n\\nOur numbers look like this:\\n\\n1096.43 = 650 + ((1000 – 500) ÷ 1.12)\\n\\nWhen using the CPIC efficiency indicator and ETC with typical variances, our expected final\\n\\nvalue for this work component (or project) is $1,096.43.\\n\\nEAC using remaining budget is the ACC plus the budget needed to finish the remaining work. This calculation is used when you expect variances to be atypical. The formula looks like this:\\n\\nEAC = ACC + BAC – EV\\n\\n3601.book  Page 406  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n406\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nOur example project estimates looks like this using an EV value of 500:\\n\\n1150 = 650 + 1000 – 500\\n\\nBased on our remaining budget, the expected final value for this work component assuming\\n\\nvariances are atypical is $1,150.\\n\\nFor study purposes, the three EAC calculations are shown together next:\\n\\nEAC = ACC + ETC (Use when you have a new estimate or when original assumptions were flawed.) EAC = ACC + ((BAC – EV) ÷ CPIC) (Use when variances are typical.)\\n\\nEAC = ACC + BAC – EV (Use when variances are atypical.)\\n\\nProject Performance Reviews\\n\\nProject performance reviews are similar to status reviews. They examine milestones due and those that have been met. They also look at the costs associated with performance and schedule activities that are over and under budget. Typically, performance reviews take place as meetings and their purpose is to examine schedule activities, work packages, or cost account status and their progress to date. There are three types of analyses associated with performance reviews: variance analysis, trend analysis, and earned value technique. We’ve already covered the earned value technique, so let’s look at the other two.\\n\\nVariance at Completion\\n\\nVariance at completion (VAC) calculates the difference between the budget at completion and the estimate at completion. It looks like this:\\n\\nVAC = BAC – EAC\\n\\nUse the most optimistic EAC number:\\n\\n–171.43 = 925 – 1096.43\\n\\nThe negative number means you’re not doing as well with costs as you anticipated and that\\n\\nvariance exists. As the project progresses, variances will become smaller.\\n\\nRemember that variance analysis is a tool and technique of both Schedule Control and Scope Control and this formula can be used in conjunction with the variance analysis tool and tech- nique of these processes.\\n\\nTrend Analysis\\n\\nAccording to A Guide to the PMBOK, trend analysis determines if project performance is improving or worsening over time by periodically analyzing project results. These results are measured with mathematical formulas that attempt to forecast project outcomes based on his- torical information and results. There are several formulas you can use to predict project trends, but it’s outside the scope of this book to go into them. For the exam, you’re expected to under- stand the concept behind trend analysis, not the formulas used to calculate it. You’ll want to remember that the results you’ve analyzed using trend analysis formulas can be used to predict future project behavior or trends.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 407  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nManaging Cost Changes\\n\\n407\\n\\nYou’ll be given some scratch paper when you go into the exam. I recommend that you write these formulas down on a piece of your scratch paper before you start the exam and keep it handy. That way, the formulas are off your mind and you’ve got them in front of you to reference when you get to the portion of the exam where these questions appear. You might want to use this tip for other items you’ve memorized as well. If you write them down before you begin, you don’t have to jog your memory on every question. If you forget something, leave a blank space where it goes and as soon as you remember it or see a question that reminds you what it is, fill in the blank.\\n\\nProject Management Software and Variance Management\\n\\nI know you thought we were done, but there a couple of remaining tools and techniques of this process you should know: project management software and variance management.\\n\\nWe’ve discussed project management software before. Obviously, many of these calculations\\n\\ncan be performed and monitored using project management software.\\n\\nVariance management includes the processes for managing cost variances and appropriate responses based on the impact and level of variance. The cost management plan should describe the variance management.\\n\\nCost Control Outputs\\n\\nThere are eight outputs to the Cost Control process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCost estimate updates\\n\\nCost baseline updates\\n\\nPerformance measurements\\n\\nForecasted completion\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process asset updates (lessons learned)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nWe’ve discussed most of these before or they are self-explanatory. However, I’ll point out a\\n\\nfew things you should be aware of for the exam.\\n\\nUpdated cost estimates include updating original cost estimates and other areas of the project management plan that these estimates may impact. As an example, perhaps the cost estimate for new hardware required for your project was recently revised. Suppose the cost estimate was needed because the equipment originally planned for in the project is no longer available and new equipment is ordered in its place. This may require revisions to other project activities, which will require you to revisit the project Planning and Executing processes.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 408  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n408\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nRecap of Formulas\\n\\nThere are a lot of formulas to memorize. Keep in mind that you’ll be given a calculator when you take the exam, so you don’t have to do the math manually. Remember that EVT is used with both the performance analysis measurement tool and technique and the project performance reviews tool and technique. Variance and trend analysis are part of the project performance reviews tool and technique. Here are the formulas we’ve covered in this chapter:\\n\\nPerformance measurements Cost variance: CV = EV – AC Schedule variance: SV = EV – PV\\n\\nPerformance indexes Cost performance index: CPI = EV ÷ AC Cumulative cost performance index: CPIC = EVC ÷ ACC Schedule performance index: SPI = EV ÷ PV\\n\\nForecasting Estimate to complete (cost to complete remaining work)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nBased on new estimate: manual calculation by project team\\n\\nETC with typical variances: ETC = (BAC – EVC) ÷ CPIC\\n\\nETC with atypical variances: ETC = (BAC – EVC)\\n\\nEstimate at completion (expected total cost at completion)\\n\\nUsing new estimate when assumptions are flawed: EAC = ACC + ETC\\n\\nEAC using CPIC (typical variances): EAC = ACC + ((BAC – EV) ÷ CPIC)\\n\\nEAC using remaining budget (atypical variances): EAC = ACC + BAC – EV\\n\\nVariance Analysis Variance analysis: VAC = BAC – EAC\\n\\nRemember that there are 12 formulas total (one is simply a manual calculation by the project team). You might want to devise an acronym or some other mnemonic to help you memorize them. For example, the earned value and performance index formulas are (based on the first letter of each formula): C-S-C-C-S. The forecasting formulas are: ETC new; ETC typical, ETC atypical; EAC new, EAC atypical, EAC typical.\\n\\nCost Control problems come about for many reasons, including incorrect esti- mating techniques, predetermined or fixed budgets with no flexibility, schedule overruns, inadequate WBS development, and so on. Good project management planning techniques during the Planning processes may prevent cost problems later in the project. At a minimum, proper planning will reduce the impact of these problems if they do occur.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 409  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Schedule Changes\\n\\n409\\n\\nAlways inform appropriate stakeholders of revised cost estimates and any changes of signif- icant impact to the project. Keep them updated on changes, status, and risk conditions during regularly scheduled project meetings.\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling\\n\\nSchedule Changes\\n\\nThe Schedule Control process involves determining the status of the project schedule, determin- ing if changes have occurred or should, and influencing and managing schedule changes. In the following sections, we will look at this process’s inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs.\\n\\nSchedule Control Inputs\\n\\nSchedule Control inputs include the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSchedule management plan\\n\\nSchedule baseline\\n\\nPerformance reports\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\nWe’ve covered each of these inputs previously. Keep in mind that the Schedule Control pro- cess works hand in hand with the Integrated Change Control process covered earlier (as all the change control processes do).\\n\\nSchedule and Control Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of the Schedule Control process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProgress reporting\\n\\nSchedule change control system\\n\\nPerformance measurement\\n\\nVariance analysis\\n\\nProject management software\\n\\nSchedule comparison bar charts\\n\\nProgress Reporting\\n\\nProgress reporting examines elements like actual start and end dates for schedule activities and the remaining time to finish uncompleted activities. If you’ve taken earned value measurements, that information is included in the progress report. All of this information should be documented.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 410  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n410\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nSchedule Change Control System\\n\\nAs you’ve probably already guessed, the schedule change control system works just like the cost change control system, except that it defines how changes to the schedule are made and man- aged. It tracks and records change requests, describes the procedures to follow to implement schedule changes, and details the authorization levels needed to approve the schedule changes.\\n\\nSchedule changes may be potential hot buttons with certain stakeholders and can burn you if you don’t handle them correctly. No one likes to hear that the project is going to take longer than originally planned. That doesn’t mean you should withhold this information, however. Always report the truth. If you’ve been keeping your stakeholders abreast of project status, they should already know that the potential for schedule changes exists. Nevertheless, be prepared to justify the reason for the schedule change, or start dusting off your resume— one or the other.\\n\\nPerformance Measurement\\n\\nPerformance measurements for schedule control include the schedule variance and schedule performance index. Both of these should be used to determine if corrective action is needed to get the schedule back on track.\\n\\nVariance Analysis\\n\\nVariance analysis is a key factor in monitoring and controlling project time because this tech- nique helps determine variances in schedule start and end dates. Comparing the estimated dates to the actual or forecasted dates will show you where variances have occurred—or may occur— and will allow you to implement corrective actions to keep the schedule on track.\\n\\nKeeping the schedule on track means you’re monitoring and controlling time— one of the triple constraints.\\n\\nMake sure to examine the float variance of the critical path activities. Thinking back to the Schedule Development process, you’ll recall that float is the amount of time you can delay start- ing an activity without increasing the amount of time it takes to complete the project. Because the activities with the least amount of float have the potential to cause the biggest schedule delay, examine float variance in ascending order of critical activities.\\n\\nHowever, not all schedule variances will impact the schedule. For example, a delay to a noncrit- ical path task will not delay the overall schedule and may not need corrective action. Use caution here though—if a delay occurs on a noncritical path task or its duration is increased for some reason, that task can actually become part of the critical path. Delays to critical path tasks will always cause delays to the project completion date and do require corrective action. Careful watch of the vari- ances in schedule start and end dates helps you control the total time element of the project.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 411  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Schedule Changes\\n\\n411\\n\\nProject Management Software\\n\\nProject management software is used to track the actual schedule dates against planned schedule dates. One particular use for project management software in the Schedule Control process is to forecast the impacts of schedule changes (both potential changes and actual changes) to the schedule.\\n\\nSchedule Comparison Bar Charts\\n\\nThe last tool and technique is the schedule comparison bar charts. This is a standard bar chart that depicts two bars for each schedule activity—one bar for the approved schedule baseline and one bar for the actual status.\\n\\nSchedule Control Outputs\\n\\nThe Schedule Control process has the following outputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nSchedule model data updates\\n\\nSchedule baseline updates\\n\\nPerformance measurements\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended corrective action\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process asset updates (lessons learned)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nActivity list updates\\n\\nActivity attributes updates\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nSchedule data model updates involve adjusting activities and dates to coincide with approved changes and/or corrective actions and updating any schedule model data used to manage the project.\\n\\nOften, project schedule network diagrams require updates as a result of schedule model data\\n\\nupdates. Don’t forget to document these changes and inform your stakeholders.\\n\\nChanges to approved schedule start and end dates (in the schedule baseline) are called revi- sions. These generally occur as a result of a project scope change or changes to activity estimates and may result in a schedule baseline update. Schedule baseline updates occur when significant changes to the project schedule are made like the changes just mentioned. This means a new schedule baseline is established that reflects the changed project activity dates. Once the new baseline is established, it is used as the basis for future performance measurements. Never rebaseline a schedule without first saving a copy of the original baseline and schedule.\\n\\nTake care when rebaselining a project schedule because you may lose the original baseline information. Why do you care? Because the original baseline serves as historical information to reference for future projects. Make a backup copy of the original schedule so that you have a record of the original baseline as a reference. Even though some project management software allows you to save several base- lines plus the original, it’s still good practice to make a backup copy of the original.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 412  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n412\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nThe performance measurements for Schedule Control are the schedule variance and schedule performance index. I know this sounds like a broken record, but make certain to document this information and communicate it to the stakeholders.\\n\\nChanges to the project schedule may or may not require updates to other elements of the project plan. For example, extending a schedule activity involving a contractor may impact the costs associated with that activity.\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions, as with other processes we’ve looked at, require root cause analysis. In the Schedule Control process, because you’re dealing with time issues, it’s impera- tive that you act as quickly as possible to implement corrective actions so that the schedule is brought back in line with the plan and the least amount of schedule delay as possible is expe- rienced. The remaining Schedule Control outputs have been discussed previously.\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Risk\\n\\nNow we’ll shift our attention to risk. The Risk Monitoring and Control process primarily involves identifying and responding to new risks as they occur. The other functions of this pro- cess are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nTracking and monitoring identified risks\\n\\nEvaluating risk response plans that are put into action as a result of risk events\\n\\n(cid:2) Monitoring the project for risk triggers\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nReexamining existing risks\\n\\n(cid:2) Monitoring residual risks\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nEnsuring that policies and procedures are followed\\n\\nEnsuring that risk response plans and contingency plans are put into action appropriately and are effective\\n\\nContingency reserves (for schedule and cost) are updated\\n\\nRisk Monitoring and Control is a busy process. During the course of the project, risk\\n\\nresponses (developed during the Planning process group) have been implemented and hopefully reduced or averted the impact of risk events.\\n\\nRisk Monitoring and Control Inputs\\n\\nThere are five inputs to this process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRisk management plan\\n\\nRisk register\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\n(cid:2) Work performance information\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nPerformance reports\\n\\n3601.book  Page 413  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Risk\\n\\n413\\n\\nYou’ll recall that the risk management plan details how risk is managed and the risk response plan describes how you will implement plans and strategies in the event of an actual risk event. Keep in mind that some risk events identified in risk planning will happen and some will not. You will have to stay alert for risk event occurrences and be prepared to respond to them when they do occur. This means you should monitor the risk register regularly.\\n\\nApproved change requests can introduce new risks to the project. It’s good practice to review all approved change requests for the potential for new threats or opportunities or in light of pre- viously identified risks and opportunities. They may also alter previously identified risks, which can mean action is needed during this process to bring response plans into alignment with the changes.\\n\\nWork performance information gathered during the Performance Reporting process, cost\\n\\nchanges, schedule changes, and/or scope changes may identify new risks.\\n\\nPerformance reports include information such as status reports, performance measurements,\\n\\nand forecasts. These should also be examined from the perspective of risks or risk response plans that may need close monitoring or changes to the response plans to coincide with the per- formance reports data.\\n\\nAdditional risk response planning may be needed to deal with the new risks or with expected risks whose impact was greater than expected. This may require repeating the Risk Response Planning process to create new contingency plans or alternative plans to deal with the risk, or it may require modification to existing plans.\\n\\nRisk Monitoring and Control Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of Risk Monitoring and Control are used to monitor risks throughout the life of the project. Periodic reviews, audits, and new earned value analyses should be performed to check the pulse of risk activity and to make certain risk management is enacted effectively.\\n\\nThe tools and techniques of this process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRisk reassessment\\n\\nRisk audits\\n\\nVariance and trend analysis\\n\\nTechnical performance measurement\\n\\nReserve analysis\\n\\nStatus meetings\\n\\nLet’s look at risk reassessment, risk audits, and technical performance measurements next. We’ve\\n\\nexamined all the other tools and techniques of this process in discussions of previous processes.\\n\\nRisk Reassessment\\n\\nPeriodic, scheduled reviews of identified risks, risk responses, and risk priorities should occur during the project. The idea here is to monitor risks and their status and determine if their con- sequences still have the same impact on the project objectives as when they were originally planned. Every status meeting (another output of this process) should have a time set aside to discuss and review risks and response plans.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 414  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n414\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nRisk identification and monitoring is an ongoing process throughout the life of the project.\\n\\nRisks can change, and previously identified risks may have greater impacts than originally thought as more facts are discovered. Reassessment of risks should be a regular activity per- formed by everyone involved on the project. Monitor the risk register, including those risks that have low scores, and risk triggers. You should also monitor the risk responses that have been implemented for their effectiveness in dealing with risk. You may have to revisit the Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis processes when new risk consequences are discovered or risk impacts are found to be greater than what was originally planned.\\n\\nRisk Audits\\n\\nRisk audits are carried out during the entire life of the project by risk auditors. Risk auditors are not typically project team members and are expertly trained in audit techniques and risk assessment. These audits are specifically interested in looking at the implementation and the effective use of risk strategies.\\n\\nTechnical Performance Measurements\\n\\nThis tool and technique compares the technical accomplishments of project milestones com- pleted during the Executing processes to the technical milestones defined in the project Planning processes. Variances may indicate that a project risk is looming, and you’ll want to analyze and prepare a response to it if appropriate. For example, a technical milestone for a new computer software project might require that the forms printed from a particular module include a bar code at the bottom of the page. If the bar code functionality does not work once the module is coded, a technical deviation exists, which means you should reexamine project risks. In this par- ticular example, project scope is likely at risk.\\n\\nRisk Monitoring and Control Outputs\\n\\nRisk Monitoring and Control should occur throughout the life of the project. Identified risks are monitored and plans are reexamined to determine if they will adequately resolve the risk as it approaches during this process. Several outputs may come about as a result of monitoring risks:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nRisk register updates\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended corrective action\\n\\nRecommended preventive action\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process updates (lessons learned, risk templates)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nWe’ve discussed many of these outputs before, so I’ll just bring to your attention the new\\n\\npoints you need to know here.\\n\\nThe risk register should be updated under two conditions. The first condition is when a risk\\n\\naudit or risk reassessment concludes that some element of the original risk information has changed. For example, the impact or probability scores are updated to reflect new conditions,\\n\\n3601.book  Page 415  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Risk\\n\\n415\\n\\nor the priority of the risk has changed, or the response plan has been updated, and so on. The second condition for updating the risk register is when the risk needs to be closed. If you have a risk event occur, you’ll record that in the risk register along with the effectiveness of the response plan. This information becomes an input to the Close Project Process, which we’ll cover in the next chapter.\\n\\nRequested changes must be processed through the Integrated Change Control process. You may find a workaround is needed when implementing a requested change or recommended cor- rective action. A workaround is an unplanned response to a negative risk event. It attempts to deal with the risk in a productive, efficient manner. If no risk response plan exists (this might be the case when you accept a risk event during the Planning process), or an unplanned risk occurs, workarounds are implemented to deal with the consequences of the risk.\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nStakeholders have asked for an updated status on the project schedule as well as a remaining cost projection. You decide to provide several cost and schedule performance figures for the project on the status report.\\n\\n“Build-out is behind schedule. They were scheduled to be completed by the 15th of January, but they aren’t going to finish up until the 24th.”\\n\\n“What’s that do to my schedule?” Jill asks. “I’m starting interviews for the store positions on the 16th. I hope to have that wrapped up by the 19th. As long as I have the majority of the staff hired by the 20th, we can have them stocking shelves starting the 22nd.”\\n\\nYou tell Jill, “Let’s finish up the status of the other items, and I’ll come back to that.\\n\\nYou’ve calculated some performance measurements, including earned value measures, and you show them to Jill and Dirk (all figures are in millions of dollars):\\n\\nBAC = 2; PV = 1.86; EVC = 1.75; ACC = 1.70\\n\\nCPIC is 1.03. (1.75 ÷ 1.70)\\n\\nSPI is .94 (1.75 ÷ 1.86)\\n\\nEAC is 1.94 (1.70 + ((2 – 1.75) ÷ 1.03)))\\n\\nETC is .24 (1.94 – 1.70)\\n\\n“What is all this telling us?” Dirk asks.\\n\\n“The cost performance index tells us we’re getting a good return for the money spent on the project so far. In other words, we’ve experienced a $1.03 value for every dollar spent to date.\\n\\n“The schedule performance index isn’t as cheery, but it’s not dreadful news either. This perfor- mance indicator says that work is progressing at 94 percent of what we anticipated by this point.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 416  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n416\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\n“The estimate at completion tells us that based on what we know today, the total project will cost $1.94 million. That’s coming in under the original $2 million we had budgeted for comple- tion, so we’re on track with the project budget.\\n\\n“The last figure is the estimated cost of the remaining work.”\\n\\n“It looks like we’re a little behind schedule based on what you have figured here,” Dirk says.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s correct,” you reply. “That brings us back to Jill’s question. I have two alternatives to propose. One, we overlap the schedule and allow Gomez’s crew to complete their work while Jill’s staff starts stocking shelves.”\\n\\nJill says, “I don’t like this option. We’ll be tripping over each other, and I don’t want merchan- dise damaged by workers who are still dragging equipment around inside the store. What’s your other option?”\\n\\n“We could ask Gomez to increase the crew size so that they complete on time according to the contract. We have a provision in the contract that stipulates they add crew members if it looks as though they’ll miss the scheduled completion date. I will instruct the contract management department to inform Gomez that we’re requiring additional crew members.”\\n\\n“That will do the trick,” Jill says. “We need the storefront to ourselves when stocking and pre- paring for opening. I’m glad you had that stipulation in the contract.”\\n\\nYour next agenda item is change requests. Ricardo submitted a change request regarding the hardware installation at the new store site. A new, much anticipated operating system was just released, and Ricardo has plans to upgrade the entire company to the new operating system. Since he must purchase new equipment for this store anyway, he contends that it makes sense to go ahead and purchase the hardware with the newest operating system already loaded. His staff won’t have to upgrade this store as part of the upgrade project because the store will already have the new operating system.\\n\\nRicardo’s change request was submitted in writing through the change control system. A CCB was set up during the Planning stages of this project to handle change requests. At the CCB meeting, the following questions come up regarding Ricardo’s request: Has the new operating system been tested with the existing system? Are there compatibility problems? If so, what risks are associated with getting the problems resolved and the equipment installed by open- ing day? Is the vendor ready to ship with the new operating system?\\n\\nThe CCB defers their decision for this request until Ricardo gives them answers to these questions.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 417  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nMonitoring and Controlling Risk\\n\\n417\\n\\nDuring the next CCB meeting, the board reviews a change request from Jill Overstreet. The gourmet food supplier she used went out of business a month or so ago, and Jill contracted with a new vendor. She received a sample shipment from the new vendor and was very unhappy with the results. Upon inspecting the products, she found broken containers and dam- aged packaging. Meanwhile, Jill found another vendor, who has sent her a sample shipment. She is very pleased with the new vendor’s products and service. However, this vendor’s prices are even higher than the first replacement vendor she contracted with. Jill submitted a cost change request to the CCB because of the increased cost of the gourmet food product ship- ment. The change in cost does not have a significant impact on the budget because the new EAC with this change is $1.90 million. The original project budget estimate was $2 million, so the project is still coming in under budget.\\n\\nYou hold a seat on the CCB and are aware of the change requests and their impacts to the project. Ricardo satisfactorily answered all the questions the CCB had, so his request and Jill’s request were both approved during the meeting.\\n\\nProject Case Study Checklist\\n\\nIntegrated change management\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nIdentify that a change has occurred\\n\\nReview and approve changes\\n\\nConfiguration management systems\\n\\nConfiguration identification\\n\\nConfiguration status accounting\\n\\nConfiguration verification and auditing\\n\\nChange control system\\n\\nFormal change request procedures\\n\\nCost change\\n\\nCost change control system\\n\\nPerformance measurement analysis\\n\\nForecasting\\n\\n3601.book  Page 418  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n418\\n\\nChapter 10 (cid:2) Monitoring and Controlling Change\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis chapter examined several change control processes starting with Integrated Change Control. Change control is an important part of the project process. It’s your responsibility as project man- ager to manage change and implement corrective action where needed to keep the project on track with the plan.\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control concerns influencing the things that cause change and managing\\n\\nthe change once it has occurred. One or more of the triple constraints are generally affected when change occurs. Managing change may involve changes to the project plan, the project schedule, or the project budget. Changes that impact processes you’ve already completed require updates to those processes. Corrective action is often a result of change and ensures that the future performance of the project lines up with the project management plan.\\n\\nConfiguration management systems typically include change control systems that document the procedures to manage change and how change requests are implemented. Change requests may come in written or verbal forms, but ideally you should ask for all your change requests in writing. Change requests are processed through a formal change control system, and configu- ration control boards have the authority to approve or deny change requests.\\n\\nLessons learned become part of the historical information used on future projects. They also are used to document the causes of the variances that occur on the project. Lessons learned are updated as part of the organizational process asset outputs of the change control processes. Schedule Control involves determining the status of the project schedule, determining if\\n\\nchanges have occurred or should, and influencing and managing schedule changes.\\n\\nCost Control involves managing changes to project costs. It’s also concerned with monitor-\\n\\ning project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from getting included in the cost baseline. Cost Control uses tools and techniques like performance measurement analysis (such as CV, SV, CPI, SPI), forecasting (ETC and EAC), and project performance reviews (variance analysis, trend analysis, and EVT) to monitor costs.\\n\\nRisk Monitoring and Control responds to risks as they occur and implements workarounds for unplanned risk events. Some risks planned for during the Risk Response Planning process will occur, and some will not. Perhaps risks that were previously identified do occur, and their impacts are much greater than anticipated during the Risk Response Planning process. These will require updates to the risk management plan or workarounds.\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nName the purpose of the Integrated Change Control process. formed throughout the life of the project and involves reviewing all the project change requests, estab- lishing a configuration management and change control process, and approving or denying changes.\\n\\nIntegrated Change Control is per-\\n\\nBe able to define the purpose of a configuration management system.

B. Integrated Change Control, Schedule Control, and Cost Control are all concerned with three things: influencing the things that cause change, determining that change is needed or has hap- pened, and managing the change.\\n\\n2. D. Change control systems are documented procedures that describe how to submit change\\n\\nrequests. They track the status of the change requests, document the management impacts of change, track the change approval status, and define the level of authority needed to approve changes. Change control systems do not approve or deny the changes—that’s the responsibility of the configuration control board (CCB).\\n\\n3. C. The key to this question was that the characteristics of the product were documented with this tool. Configuration management documents the physical characteristics and the function- ality of the product of the project.\\n\\n4. C. Configuration control boards (CCBs) review change requests and have the authority to\\n\\napprove or deny them. Their authority is defined by the organization.\\n\\n5. B. Schedule variances will sometimes—but not always—impact the schedule. Changes to non-\\n\\ncritical path tasks will not likely impact the schedule, but changes to critical path tasks will always impact the schedule.\\n\\n6. C. Cost Control tracks project performance to detect variances and reflect them in the cost base-\\n\\nline. It’s also used to prevent inappropriate changes from getting into the cost baseline.\\n\\n7. D. Budget updates may require cost rebaselining.\\n\\n8. A. The three activities associated with configuration management include configuration identi-\\n\\nfication, configuration status accounting, and configuration verification and auditing.\\n\\n9. B. Configuration identification involves identifying the products of the project, determining the status of changes to the configuration, and verifying and auditing the configuration to determine if the performance and functional requirements have been met.\\n\\n10. Answer: A. Schedule variance is (EV – PV) and schedule performance index is (EV ÷ PV).\\n\\n11. C. Earned value is referred to as the value of the work that’s been completed to date compared\\n\\nto the budget.\\n\\n12. D. The CV is a positive number and is calculated by subtracting AC from EV as follows: 250 – 200 = 50. A positive CV means the project is coming in under budget, meaning you’ve spent less than you planned as of the measurement date.\\n\\n13. A. The SV calculation is EV – PV. If PV is a higher number than EV, you’ll get a negative number\\n\\nas a result.\\n\\n14. B. CPI is calculated as follows: EV ÷ AC. In this case, 250 ÷ 200 = 1.25.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 425  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nAnswers to Review Questions\\n\\n425\\n\\n15. B. When variances are not expected to continue, or are atypical in nature, EAC is calculated as\\n\\nfollows: ACC + BAC – EV. Therefore, the calculation for this question looks like this: (200 + 800) – 250 = 750.\\n\\n16. C. The correct formula for ETC for this question is as follows: BAC – EVC. Therefore, ETC is\\n\\nas follows: 375 – 250 = 125.\\n\\n17. A. When variances are expected to continue, EAC is calculated as follows: ACC + ((BAC – EV) ÷ CPIC). Therefore, the calculation for this question looks like this: 200 + ((800 – 250) ÷ 1.25) = 640.\\n\\n18. D. You first have to calculate EAC in order to calculate VAC. EAC for variances that are atypical is ACC + BAC – EV. So our numbers are 275 + 500 – 250 = 525. VAC is calculated this way: BAC – EAC. Therefore, 500 – 525 = –25. Our costs are not doing as well as anticipated.\\n\\n19. C. You must first calculate CPIC in order to calculate ETC. CPIC is EVC ÷ ACC. We have 250 ÷ 275 = .91. ETC with typical variances is (BAC – EVC) ÷ CPIC. Our numbers are (500 – 250) ÷ .91 = 274.7.\\n\\n20. B. Workarounds are unplanned responses. Workarounds deal with negative risk events as they occur. As the name implies, workarounds were not previously known to the project team. The risk event was unplanned, so no contingency plan existed to deal with the risk event, and thus it required a workaround.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 426  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n3601.book  Page 427  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nChapter\\n\\n11\\n\\nControlling Work\\n\\nResults and Closing\\n\\nOut the Project\\n\\nTHE PMP EXAM CONTENT FROM THE MONI- TORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nEnsure Project Deliverables Conform to Quality Standards\\n\\nTHE PMP EXAM CONTENT FROM THE CLOSING THE PROJECT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nObtain Final Acceptance for the Project\\n\\nObtain Financial, Legal, and Administrative Closure\\n\\nRelease Project Resources\\n\\nIdentify, Document, and Communicate Lessons Learned\\n\\nCreate and Distribute Final Project Report\\n\\nArchive and Retain Project Records\\n\\nMeasure Customer Satisfaction\\n\\n3601.book  Page 428  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nYou’ve made it to the homestretch. This chapter covers the last group of project processes. We’ll close out the Monitoring and Controlling process group and also discuss the Closing process\\n\\ngroup. Most of the hard part is over, but you aren’t quite done yet.\\n\\nIn the Monitoring and Controlling group, we’ll cover Perform Quality Control, Scope Ver- ification, and Scope Control. The Perform Quality Control process involves several new tools and techniques that may show up on the exam. Take some time here to understand the tools and techniques in the Perform Quality Control process and to differentiate them from the tools and techniques associated with the Quality Planning and Perform Quality Control processes. Remember that Perform Quality Control tools and techniques are listed as tools and tech- niques for the Perform Quality Assurance process. Scope Verification involves verifying and accepting work results. Scope Control is like the change control processes we discussed in Chapter 10 and is concerned with controlling changes to project scope.\\n\\nThe Closing process group has two processes: Close Project and Contract Closure. The Close Project process is concerned with verifying that the work of the project was completed correctly and to the stakeholders’ satisfaction. Contract Closure supports the Close Project process and also verifies that the work of the project was completed correctly and the deliverables accepted. Project closeout is the most often neglected process of all the project processes. Once the project is over, it’s easy to pack things up, throw some files in a drawer, and start moving right into planning the next project. However, don’t be so quick to chuck your project just yet. There are a few things to take care of during this process that might make life easier for you on the next project.\\n\\nOne of the most important functions of this process is obtaining formal acceptance of the product of the project from stakeholders and customers. You’ll want to get an official sign-off from the stakeholders acknowledging acceptance of the product and then file this with the project documents.\\n\\nUtilizing Perform Quality\\n\\nControl Techniques\\n\\nQuality Planning, Perform Quality Assurance, and Perform Quality Control are part of the project Quality Management Knowledge Area. These processes work together to define and monitor the work of the project and to make certain the results meet the quality requirements laid out in the plan.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 429  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUtilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques\\n\\n429\\n\\nPerform Quality Control\\n\\nis specifically concerned with monitoring work results to see if they comply with the standards set out in the quality management plan. Perform Quality Control should be practiced and performed throughout the project to identify and remove the causes of unacceptable results. Remember that Perform Quality Control is concerned with project results both from a management perspective, such as schedule and cost performance, and from a prod- uct perspective. In other words, the end product should conform to the requirements and product description defined during the Planning processes.\\n\\nPerform Quality Control Inputs\\n\\nPerform Quality Control includes the following inputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nQuality management plan\\n\\nQuality metrics\\n\\nQuality checklists\\n\\nOrganizational process assets\\n\\nWork performance information\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\nWe’ve discussed each of these inputs previously, so let’s move on to tools and techniques.\\n\\nPerform Quality Control Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThis list of tools and techniques in the Perform Quality Control process includes several that haven’t been discussed before:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nCause\\n\\n\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\n\\neffect diagram\\n\\nControl charts\\n\\nFlowcharting\\n\\nHistogram\\n\\nPareto chart\\n\\nRun chart\\n\\nScatter diagram\\n\\nStatistical sampling\\n\\nInspection\\n\\nDefect repair review\\n\\nThe primary purpose of each of these tools is to examine the product and/or the project pro- cesses for conformity to standards. If the results fall within the tolerance range specified, the results are acceptable. Alternatively, if the results fall within the control limits set for the prod- uct (as defined by the various tools and techniques we’ll discuss in the following sections), the\\n\\n3601.book  Page 430  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n430\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2)\\n\\nControlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nprocess is said to be in control. Spend time understanding these tools and techniques and their individual uses because there may be exam questions on each of them.\\n\\nWe talked about cause-and-effect diagrams as a diagramming technique in the Risk Identification process in Chapter 5, “Risk Planning.” If you need a refresher, refer to Figure 5.2 in that chapter. We also discussed flowcharts in the same section of Chapter 5. Flowcharts are diagrams that show the logical steps that must be performed in order to accomplish an objective. They can also show how the individual elements of a system interrelate. Flowcharting can help identify where qual- ity problems might occur on the project and how problems happen. This is important because it allows the project team the opportunity to develop alternative approaches for dealing with anticipated quality problems identified with this tool and technique.\\n\\nHistograms are typically bar charts that depict the distribution of variables over time. There is an example histogram in Chapter 6, “Resource Planning.” In Perform Quality Control, the his- togram usually depicts the attributes of the problem or situation. (We’ll discuss attributes shortly.) We will look at the other tools and techniques in more detail in the following sections.\\n\\nControl Charts\\n\\nControl charts measure the results of processes over time and display the results in graph form. Control charts are a way to measure variances to determine if process variances are in control or out of control.\\n\\nA control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen and measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Perform Quality Control is usually maintained—or said to be in control—within plus or minus three standard deviations. In other words, Perform Quality Control says that if the process is in control (that is, the measurements fall within the control limits), you know that 99.73 percent of the parts going through the pro- cess will fall within an acceptable range of the mean. If you discover a part outside of this range, you should investigate and determine if corrective action is needed.\\n\\nFigure 11.1 illustrates an example control chart.\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 1 . 1\\n\\nControl chart\\n\\n5.06\\n\\n5.00\\n\\n4.94\\n\\nUpper\\n\\nControl\\n\\nLimit\\n\\nX (Mean)\\n\\nLower\\n\\nControl\\n\\nLimit\\n\\n3601.book  Page 431  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUtilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques\\n\\n431\\n\\nYou’ve determined from your sample measurements that 5 mm is the mean in the example con- trol chart. One standard deviation equals 0.02. Three standard deviations on either side of the mean become your upper and lower control points on this chart. Therefore, if all control points fall within plus or minus three standard deviations on either side of the mean, the process is in control. If points fall outside of the acceptable limits, the process is not in control and corrective action is needed.\\n\\nControl charts are used most often in manufacturing settings where repetitive activities are easily monitored. For example, the process that produces widgets by the case lot must meet cer- tain specifications and fall within certain variances to be considered in control. However, you aren’t limited to using control charts only in the manufacturing industry. They can be used to monitor any output. You might consider using control charts to track and monitor project man- agement processes. You could plot cost variances, schedule variances, frequency or number of scope changes, and so on to help monitor variances in the project management process.\\n\\nPareto Chart\\n\\nYou have probably heard of the 80/20 rule. Vilfredo Pareto is the person credited with discov- ering this rule. He observed that 80 percent of the wealth and land ownership in Italy was held by 20 percent of the population. Over the years, others have shown that the 80/20 rule applies across many disciplines and areas. As an example, generally speaking, 80 percent of the deposits of any given financial institution are held by 20 percent of its customer base. Let’s hope that rule doesn’t apply to project managers though, with 20 percent of the project managers out there doing 80 percent of the work!\\n\\nAccording to Pareto, the 80/20 rule as it applies to quality says that a small number of causes (20 percent) create the majority of the problems (80 percent). Have you ever noticed that with your project or department staff? It always seems that just a few people cause the biggest head- aches. But we’re getting off track.\\n\\nPareto charts\\n\\nare displayed as histograms that rank-order the most important factors such as delays, costs, defects, or other factors by their frequency over time. His theory is that you get the most benefit if you spend the majority of your time fixing the most important problems. The information shown in Table 11.1 is plotted on an example Pareto chart shown in Figure 11.2.\\n\\nT A B L E 1 1 . 1\\n\\nFrequency of Failures\\n\\nItem\\n\\nDefect Frequency\\n\\nPercent of Defects\\n\\nCumulative Percent\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\nC\\n\\nD\\n\\nE\\n\\n800\\n\\n700\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n.33\\n\\n.29\\n\\n.17\\n\\n.13\\n\\n.08\\n\\n.33\\n\\n.62\\n\\n.79\\n\\n.92\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n3601.book  Page 432  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n432\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2)\\n\\nControlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 1 . 2\\n\\nPareto chart\\n\\nDefect\\n\\nFrequency\\n\\n1000\\n\\n750\\n\\n500\\n\\n250\\n\\nCumulative\\n\\nPercent\\n\\n100%\\n\\n75%\\n\\n50%\\n\\n25%\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\nC\\n\\nD\\n\\nE\\n\\nThe problems are rank-ordered according to their frequency and percentage of defects. The defect frequencies in this figure are shown as black bars, and the cumulative percentages of defects are plotted as circles. The rank-ordering of these problems shows you where corrective action should be taken first. You can see in Figure 11.2 that problem A should receive priority attention because the most benefit will come from fixing this problem.\\n\\nRun Charts\\n\\nCommon causes of variances\\n\\nare used to show variations in the process over time or to show trends (like improve-\\n\\nRun charts ments or lack of improvements) in the process. Differences in results will occur in processes because there is no such thing as a perfect process. When processes are considered in control, differences in results may occur due to common causes of variances or special cause variances. come about as a result of circumstances or situations that are rel- atively unique to the process you’re using and are easily controlled at the operational level. Per- haps a machine needs calibration or procedures for the process need refinement. Perhaps your process is very detailed, with specific procedures that are carried out to produce the output. Not following these detailed procedures could result in variances known as special cause variances. For the exam, you should understand the three types of variances that make up common\\n\\ncauses of variances:\\n\\nRandom variances Random variations may be normal, depending on the processes you’re using to produce the product or service of the project, but they occur as the name implies, at random.\\n\\nKnown or predictable variances\\n\\nexist in the process.\\n\\nKnown or predictable variances are variances that you know\\n\\nVariances that are always present in the process The process itself will have inherent variabil- ity that is perhaps caused by human mistakes, machine variations or malfunctions, the environ- ment, and so on, which are known as variances always present in the process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 433  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUtilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques\\n\\n433\\n\\nCommon cause variances that do not fall within the acceptable range are difficult to correct and usually require a reorganization of the process.

Trend analysis in the Per-\\n\\nform Quality Control process is a mathematical technique that uses historical results to predict future outcomes. Trend analysis often tracks variances in cost and schedule performance by moni- toring the number of activities completed with significant variances within a certain time period. This information can then be used to forecast future performance. Trend analysis also tracks tech- nical performance by determining the number of defects observed and the number of defects not cor- rected. milestones completed to the technical milestones defined in the project Planning process group.\\n\\ncompare the technical accomplishments of project\\n\\nTechnical performance measurements\\n\\nScatter Diagrams\\n\\nScatter diagrams use two variables, one called an independent variable, which is an input, and one called a dependent variable, which is an output. Scatter diagrams display the relationship between these two elements as points on a graph. As an example, maybe your scatter diagram plots the ability of your employees to perform a certain task. Their experience performing this task in months is plotted as the independent variable on the X axis, and their score—the depen- dent variable—is plotted on the Y axis.\\n\\nThe important thing to remember about scatter diagrams is that they plot the dependent and independent variables and the closer the points resemble a diagonal line, the closer these vari- ables are related. A sample scatter diagram is shown in Figure 11.3.\\n\\nStatistical Sampling\\n\\nStatistical sampling involves taking a sample number of parts from the whole population and examining them to determine if they fall within the variances outlined by the Perform Quality Control plan. Perhaps you determine to statistically sample 25 parts out of a lot or run. The quality plan outlines that the lot will pass if four parts or fewer fall outside the allowable variance.\\n\\nStatistical sampling may also involve determining the standard deviation for a process as dis- cussed in the control chart tool and technique. The quality plan determines if plus or minus two standard deviations—95.44 percent of the population—is adequate or if plus or minus three stan- dard deviations—99.73 percent—is adequate.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 434  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n434\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2)\\n\\nControlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nF I G U R E 1 1 . 3\\n\\nScatter diagram\\n\\nScore\\n\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n50\\n\\n25\\n\\nTime in Months\\n\\nInspection\\n\\nInspection involves physically looking at, measuring, or testing results to determine if they con- form to the requirements or quality standards. It’s a tool used to gather information and improve results. Inspections might occur after the final product is produced or at intervals during the devel- opment of the product to examine individual components. Acceptance decisions are made when the work is inspected and the work is either accepted or rejected. When work is rejected, it might have to go back through the process for rework.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nDon’t confuse inspection with prevention; they’re two different things. Inspection keeps errors in the product from reaching the customer. keeps errors from occurring in the pro- cess. It always costs less to prevent problems in the first place than it does to fix problems built into the product after the fact. Rework, labor costs, material costs, and potential loss of cus- tomers are all factors to consider when weighing prevention costs versus the cost of rework. Philip Crosby developed the theory of zero defects, which deals with prevention costs. Loosely translated, zero defects means doing it right the first time.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nInspection may take actual measurements of components to determine if they meet require- ments. Maybe a component part for your product must be exactly 5 mm in length. In order to pass inspection, the parts are measured and must meet the 5 mm length requirement. If they measure 5 mm, they pass; if they do not, they fail.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 435  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nUtilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques\\n\\n435\\n\\nMeasurements can vary even if the variances are not noticeable. Machines wear down, people make mistakes, the environment may cause variances, and so on. Measurements that fall within So, instead of 5 mm exactly, maybe a range between a specified range are called 4.98 mm and 5.02 mm is an acceptable or tolerable measurement for our component. If the sam- ples that are measured fall within the tolerable range, they pass; otherwise, they fail inspection. The measurements taken dur-\\n\\nOne inspection technique uses measurements called\\n\\ntolerable results.\\n\\nattributes.\\n\\ning attribute sampling determine whether they meet one of two options, conforming or non- conforming. In other words, the measurements conform or meet the requirement, or they do not conform. This can also be considered a pass/fail or go/no-go decision.\\n\\nAttribute conformity and inspections are not necessarily performed on every component part or every end product that’s produced. That’s time consuming and inefficient when you’re produc- ing numerous components. Inspection in cases like this is usually performed on a sampling of parts or products where every\\n\\nnumber of parts is tested for conformity or measurement specifics.\\n\\nX\\n\\nInspection will tell you where problems exist and give you the opportunity to correct them, thus leading to quality improvements. The other tools and techniques we’ll talk about in these sections also lead to quality improvements in the product or process, or both. Quality improve- ments are an output of the Perform Quality Control process.\\n\\nDefect Repair Review\\n\\nIn this tool and technique, the quality control department will review the repairs that were made (as a result of quality audits) to make certain the repairs were made correctly and that the deliv- erable, or product of the project, is in compliance. You’ll remember that approved defect repairs are a result of a quality audit performed during the Perform Quality Assurance process or an inspection as part of the Perform Quality Control process. (Approved defect repairs are an input to the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.) Defect repairs correct problems you find with the product of the project. Now you’ll examine those repairs to make certain they cor- rected the problem.\\n\\nPerform Quality Control Outputs\\n\\nQuality improvements, as mentioned in the Perform Quality Assurance process discussed Chap- ter 9, are a primary goal of the quality processes. Failure to meet quality requirements can have a significant impact on the project and the project team and may result in rework. will cause a project to take longer than originally planned because the project team has to repeat processes already completed to correct the work. You should try to keep rework to a minimum so as not to impact the project schedule. Rework has the potential to cause morale issues as well, especially if the team members thought they were doing a good job all along. Rework may require the project team to put in extra long hours, which in turn may cause more errors or other negative consequences. Monitor quality periodically so that rework is kept to a minimum.\\n\\nRework\\n\\nPerform Quality Assurance is concerned with assuring that the project is using the correct and most efficient processes to meet the project requirements while Perform Quality Control is concerned with the accuracy of the project results.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 436  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n436\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2)\\n\\nControlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nThe Never\\n\\n\\n\\nEnding Bridge Project\\n\\nOne of the main thoroughfares into your city requires a bridge replacement. You were appointed the project manager for the city and have managed this project since its initiation 15 months ago.\\n\\nThe project entailed hiring a contractor to build and construct the new bridge and then managing the contract and the work of the contracting agency to bring the project to a successful completion.\\n\\nApproximately 28,000 vehicles travel across this bridge on a daily basis, carrying commuters and col- lege students back and forth to the downtown area. One of the requirements was the closure of no more than three of the six lanes of traffic at one time during construction. Another requirement stated that two coats of paint were to be applied to the steel before bringing it on-site, and a third coat of paint was to be applied at the site after construction. The paint is guaranteed to last 25 to 30 years.\\n\\nYou assisted the Perform Quality Control department with a recent inspection. The inspection revealed that some of the paint was peeling. After further investigation, you discovered that the contractor did not allow the first coat of paint to cure properly, so when the second coat was applied, it didn’t stick correctly and peeled and flaked in places.\\n\\nYou’ve instructed the contractor that according to the terms of the contract and the SOW spec- ifications, they’re required to apply three coats of paint to the bridge as part of the work of the project. Corrective action is needed to get this project back on track. As a result, the contract company decides to subcontract out the paint work to another company while they finish up their remaining tasks on the project.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the subcontractor that was hired found they were in way over their heads and were not able to complete the paint job. Several months have passed, and the original project comple- tion date was missed long ago. Obviously, revisions to the project schedule were required when it became clear that the subcontractor wasn’t going to make the date. Now another revision to the project schedule is necessary due to the subcontractor’s failure to complete the painting task.\\n\\nThe original contractor did some searching and found another subcontractor capable of com- pleting the painting job. It’s now the middle of winter. Because the temperatures are cold, the painting crew must hang insulated tarps between the bays on the bridge and use heaters to warm up small areas of steel to the proper temperature to apply the paint. This process has extended the completion date of this activity by over three times its original estimate and ulti- mately delayed the completion of the project by two years.\\n\\nCorrective action was taken as a result of the inspection, and eventually the project was com- pleted, but not without schedule delays, schedule changes, scope changes, and rework—not to mention the increased cost to the original contractor. Since the contract was a fixed-price con- tract, the contractor’s profit was eaten away paying for the painting job. The cost to correct the quality issue did not impact the city, but it did impact the contractor. This is a case where an ounce of prevention would have been worth a pound of cure, as the old saying goes.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 437  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nVerifying Project Scope\\n\\n437\\n\\nPerform Quality Control has several outputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nQuality control measurements\\n\\nValidated defect repair\\n\\nQuality baseline updates\\n\\nRecommended corrective actions\\n\\nRecommended preventive actions\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended defect repair\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process asset updates (checklists, lessons learned)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nValidated deliverables\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nWe’ve already discussed many of these outputs, but I’ll add a few quick notes here. Validated defect repairs are the results of defects that have been corrected and examined. Recommended corrective and preventive actions may result in quality improvements. Remem- ber that processes that are in control can be changed to bring about improvements, but pro- cesses in control should not be adjusted. Processes out of control may require adjusting, but this should occur only as a result of a management decision.\\n\\nRecommended defect repairs may also result from this process. The quality control department\\n\\nor team will identify the defects using the tools and techniques of this process and the defects should be logged in a database or some other tracking tool to keep track of status and resolution. Completed checklists become part of the project’s documentation and are included as part of the organizational process asset updates. Lessons learned should include the causes of vari- ances found during this process and why the corrective actions were recommended.\\n\\nValidated deliverables are the result of the work of the project. This output assures that the\\n\\ndeliverables meet the quality standards outlined in the quality management plan.\\n\\nVerifying Project Scope\\n\\nManaging and reporting on project progress is the primary focus of the Monitoring and Con- trolling processes. One of the Monitoring and Controlling processes that helps manage and con- trol project progress is the Scope Verification process.\\n\\nThe inputs of the Scope Verification are the project scope statement, WBS dictionary, project\\n\\nscope management plan, and deliverables. This process involves evaluating these inputs to determine if the work is complete and if it satisfies the project objectives. Evaluation is per- formed using inspection, which is the only tool and technique of this process. You should per- form Scope Verification—even if the project is canceled—to document the degree to which the project was completed. This serves as historical information, and if the project is ever started up again, you’ve got documentation that tells you what was completed and how far the project progressed.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 438  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n438\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nThe most important thing you should know about the Scope Verification process is that Scope Verification formalizes the acceptance of the project scope and is primarily concerned with the acceptance of work results. Don’t confuse this process with the Perform Quality Control pro- cess that we just discussed.\\n\\nYou can remember the difference between Scope Verification and Perform Quality Control this way:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nScope Verification = accepting work results\\n\\nPerform Quality Control = checking for correct work results (assuring that the quality requirements are met)\\n\\nThe outputs of Scope Verification are accepted deliverables, requested changes, and recom- mended corrective actions. Accepted deliverables concern the formal acceptance of the work by the stakeholders. Remember that stakeholders include customers, the project sponsor, the project team, the management team, and so on. Document their acceptance with formal sign- off and file it in your project notebook.\\n\\nControlling Scope Changes\\n\\nThe Scope Management Knowledge Area includes Scope Planning, Scope Definition, Create WBS, Scope Verification, and Scope Control. You’ll recall that project scope describes the work required to produce the product or service of the project. This includes the requirements of the product, which describe the features and functionality of the product or service. Product scope, on the other hand, is the description of the product features. The product description is the doc- ument that defines the characteristics of the product or service of the project.\\n\\nYou can conclude from this that the Scope Control process involves changes to the project scope. Any modification to the agreed-upon WBS is considered a scope change. (It’s been eons ago that we looked at this so remember that the WBS, or work breakdown structure, is a deliverables-oriented hierarchy that defines the total work of the project.) This means that the addition or deletion of activities or modifications to the existing activities on the WBS con- stitute a project scope change.\\n\\nChanges in product scope will require changes to the project scope as well. Let’s say one of your project deliverables is the design of a piece of specialized equipment that’s integrated into your final product. Now let’s say that due to engineering setbacks and some miscalculations, the spe- cialized equipment requires design modifications. The redesign of this equipment impacts the end product, or product scope. Since changes to the product scope impact the project require- ments, which are detailed in the scope document, changes to project scope are also required.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 439  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nControlling Scope Changes\\n\\n439\\n\\nThis change, along with recommended corrective actions, should be processed through the Inte- grated Change Control process.\\n\\nScope Control Inputs\\n\\nThere are seven inputs to the Scope Control process, all of which you’ve seen before:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS dictionary\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope management plan\\n\\nPerformance reports\\n\\nApproved change requests\\n\\n(cid:2) Work performance information\\n\\nThe first four inputs were covered in the Planning process group and the last three were dis-\\n\\ncussed in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.\\n\\nScope Control Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThere are four tools and techniques of the Scope Control process:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nChange control system\\n\\nVariance analysis\\n\\nReplanning\\n\\nConfiguration management system\\n\\nThe change control system here is just like the one described in the discussion of the Inte- grated Change Control process. It tracks and records change requests, describes the procedures to follow to implement scope change, and details the authorization levels needed to approve the changes. When your project is performed under contract, scope changes will also require con- formance to the provisions of the contract and the contract change system.\\n\\nVariance analysis includes reviewing project performance measurements to determine if there are variances in project scope. It’s also important to determine the cause of variances and examine those against the scope baseline so that you can implement corrective actions if needed. Replanning involves updating the WBS, WBS dictionary, project scope statement, and\\n\\nproject management plan when a change in scope has occurred.\\n\\nIf you are using a configuration management system to control product scope, the change\\n\\ncontrol system must also integrate with it. The configuration management system manages changes to product and project scope and assures that these changes are reasonable and make sense before they’re processed through the Integrated Change Control process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 440  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n440\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nScope Control Outputs\\n\\nThe outputs of the Scope Control process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject scope statement updates\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS updates\\n\\n(cid:2) WBS dictionary updates\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nScope baseline updates\\n\\nRequested changes\\n\\nRecommended corrective action\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets update\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan updates\\n\\nLet’s take a look at project scope statement changes and scope baseline updates. The remain-\\n\\ning outputs have all been discussed previously.\\n\\nChanges to scope will likely require that you run back through the project Planning processes\\n\\nand make any needed adjustments. This also means you’ll need to update the project scope statement so it accurately reflects the project work after the change.\\n\\nScope changes include any changes to the project scope as defined by the agreed-upon WBS. This in turn may require changes or updates to project objectives, costs, quality measures or con- trols, or time in the form of schedule revisions. Scope changes always require schedule revisions.\\n\\nSchedule revisions are always needed as a result of scope changes. But not all scope changes will necessarily cause increases to the project schedule. Some scope changes may reduce the number of hours needed to complete the project, which in turn may reduce the project budget.\\n\\nWhen scope changes are requested, all areas of the project should be investigated to deter- mine what the changes will impact. The project team should perform estimates of the impact and of the amount of time needed to make the change. Sometimes, however, the change request is so extensive that even the time to perform an estimate should be evaluated before proceeding. In other words, if the project team is busy working on estimates, they aren’t working on the project. That means extensive change requests could impact the existing schedule because of the time and effort needed just to evaluate the change. Cases like these require you to make a deter- mination or ask the change control board (CCB) to decide if the change is important enough to allow the project team time to work on the estimates.\\n\\nChanges in scope will require an update to the project scope baseline. They may also require\\n\\nupdates to the schedule, cost, or performance measurement baselines established during the Planning processes. When change is necessary, adjustments to the performance measurement baselines are made, documented, and distributed to the stakeholders as needed.\\n\\nAlways remember to update your stakeholders regarding the changes you’re implementing and their impacts. They’ll want to know how the changes impact the performance baselines, including the project costs, project schedule, project scope, and quality.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 441  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nFormulating Project Closeout\\n\\n441\\n\\nThis process concludes the Monitoring and Controlling process groups. We’ll look at the\\n\\nClosing processes in the next section.\\n\\nFormulating Project Closeout\\n\\nAll good projects must come to an end, as the saying goes. Hopefully, you’ve practiced all the things we’ve talked about that have led up to this point, and you’ve delivered a successful project to the stakeholders and customers. You’ve also put some of the vital tools of project management into play—planning, executing, controlling, and communicating—to help you reach that goal.\\n\\nBut how do you know when a project has ended successfully? Delivering the product or ser- vice of the project doesn’t mean it’s been completed satisfactorily. Remember back in the open- ing chapters that I said a project is completed successfully when it meets or exceeds stakeholders’ expectations and satisfies the goals of the project. During the Closing processes— Close Project and Contract Closure—you’ll document acceptance of the product of the project with a formal sign-off and file it with the project records for future reference. The formal sign- off is how the stakeholders will indicate that the goals have been met and that the project meets or exceeds their expectations so that the project ends.\\n\\nCharacteristics of Closing\\n\\nThere are a few characteristics common to all projects during the Closing processes. One is that the probability of completing the project is highest during this process and risk is lowest. You’ve already completed the majority of the work of the project—if not all of the work—so the prob- ability of not finishing the project is very low.\\n\\nStakeholders have the least amount of influence during the Closing processes, while project managers have the greatest amount of influence. Costs are significantly lower during this pro- cess because the majority of the project work and spending has already occurred. Remember those cost S curves we talked about in the Cost Budgeting process? This is where they taper off as project spending comes to an end.\\n\\nOne last common characteristic of projects during closing is that weak matrix organizations\\n\\ntend to experience the least amount of stress during the Closing processes.\\n\\nAll projects do eventually come to an end. Let’s examine a few of the reasons for project end-\\n\\nings before getting into the Close Project and Contract Closure processes.\\n\\nProject Endings\\n\\nProjects come to an end for several reasons:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThey’re completed successfully.\\n\\nThey’re canceled or killed prior to completion.\\n\\nThey evolve into ongoing operations and no longer exist as projects.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 442  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n442\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nThere are four formal types of project endings you might need to know for the exam:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nAddition\\n\\nStarvation\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nExtinction\\n\\nLet’s look at each of these ending types in detail.\\n\\nAddition\\n\\nProjects that evolve into ongoing operations are considered projects that end due to addition; in other words, they become their own ongoing business unit. An example of this is the instal- lation of an enterprise resource planning system. These systems are business management sys- tems that integrate all areas of a business, including marketing, planning, manufacturing, sales, financials, and human resources. After the installation of the software, these systems can develop into their own business unit because ongoing operations, maintenance, and monitoring of the software require full-time staff. These systems usually evolve into an arm of the business reporting system that no one can live without once it’s installed.\\n\\nA project is considered a project when it meets these criteria: It is unique, has a definite begin- ning and ending date, and is temporary in nature. When a project becomes an ongoing opera- tion, it is no longer a project.\\n\\nStarvation\\n\\nWhen resources are cut off from the project or are no longer provided to the project, it’s starved prior to completing all the requirements and you’re left with an unfinished project on your hands. Starvation can happen for any number of reasons:\\n\\n(cid:2) Other projects come about and take precedence over the current project, thereby cutting\\n\\nthe funding or resources for your project.\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nThe customer curtails an order.\\n\\nThe project budget is reduced.\\n\\nA key resource quits.\\n\\nResource starving can include cutting back or withholding human resources, equipment and supplies, or money. In any case, if you’re not getting the people, equipment, or money you need to complete the project, it’s going to starve and probably end abruptly.\\n\\nThis is one of those cases where documentation becomes your best friend. Organizations\\n\\ntend to have short memories. As you move on to bigger and better projects, your memory regarding the specifics of the project will fade. Six months from now when someone important wonders why that project was never completed and begins the finger-pointing routine, the project documents will clearly outline the reasons why the project ended early. That’s one of the reasons why project documentation is such an important function. We’ll talk more about doc- umenting project details shortly.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 443  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nFormulating Project Closeout\\n\\n443\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nIntegration occurs when the resources of the project—people, equipment, property, and sup- plies—are distributed to other areas in the organization or are assigned to other projects. Per- haps your organization begins to focus on other areas or other projects and the next thing you know, functional managers come calling to retrieve their resources for other, more important things. Again, your project will come to an end due to lack of resources because they have been reassigned to other areas of the business or have been pulled from your project and assigned to another project.\\n\\nThe difference between starvation and integration is that starvation results in funding or resource cuts while integration results in reassignment or redeploy- ment of the resources.\\n\\nAgain, good documentation describing the circumstances that brought about the ending of\\n\\na project due to integration should be archived with the project records for future reference.\\n\\nExtinction\\n\\nThis is the best kind of project end because extinction means the project has been completed and accepted by the stakeholders. As such, it no longer exists because it had a definite ending date, the goals of the project were achieved, and the project was closed out.\\n\\nPied Piper\\n\\nJerome Reed is the project manager for Pied Piper’s newest software project. His team is work- ing on a program that will integrate the organization’s human resource information, including payroll records, leave time accruals, contact information, and so on. His top two programmers, Brett and Kathy, are heading up the coding team and are in charge of the programming and testing activities.\\n\\nPied Piper recently hired a new CIO who started working with the company just a few weeks ago. Jerome is concerned about his human resources project. It was the former CIO’s pet project, but he’s not sure where it falls on the new CIO’s radar screen.\\n\\nJerome is in the computer room checking out the new hardware that just arrived for his project. Liz Horowitz, the director of network operations, approaches Jerome.\\n\\n“That’s a nice piece of hardware,” Liz comments.\\n\\n“It sure is. This baby is loaded. It’s going to process and serve up data to the users so fast they’ll be asking us to upgrade all the servers.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 444  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n444\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nLiz replies, “You’re right about that. I’ve asked Richard to burn it in and load the software.”\\n\\n“What software?” Jerome asks.\\n\\n“You know, the new customer relationship management software. The CIO hired some vendor she’s worked with before to come in and install their CRM system here. She said it was our top priority. I knew this new server was already on order, and it happens to be sized correctly for the new CRM system.”\\n\\n“I purchased this server for the human resources project. What am I supposed to use for that?”\\n\\nLiz answers, “I’ve got a server over there on the bottom of the third rack that might work, or maybe you can order another one. But you should take this up with the CIO. All I know is she authorized me to use this server. She understood I was taking it from your project, so maybe she’s thinking about going another direction with the human resources project.\\n\\n“You probably should know I also asked to have Brett and Kathy assigned to the CRM project. Even though it’s a vendor project, it still requires some of our coders. The CIO wanted the best, and they’re the best we’ve got. It shouldn’t take them long to make the changes I need, and then you can have them back for your project. In the meantime, they can give directions to your other programmers so they can keep working.”\\n\\n“I’m going to go see if the CIO is in,” Jerome replies.\\n\\nThis is a case where Jerome’s project ends by integration due to the reassignment of resources. The new CIO came on board and changed the direction and focus of the project priorities, making her new project a higher priority than the previous project. As a result, Jerome’s hardware and his top two resources were reassigned to the new project. Had the CIO cut the resources and equipment on the original project altogether, it would have ended due to starvation.\\n\\nClosing Out the Project\\n\\nThe key activity of the Close Project process is concerned with gathering project records and dis- seminating information to formalize acceptance of the product, service, or project as well as to perform project closure. You’ll want to review the project documents to make certain they are up- to-date. For example, perhaps some scope change requests were implemented that changed some of the characteristics of the final product. The project information you’re collecting during this process should reflect the characteristics and specifications of the final product. Don’t forget to update your resource assignments as well. Some team members will have come and gone over the course of the project; you need to double-check that all the resources and their roles and respon- sibilities are noted.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 445  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nClosing Out the Project\\n\\n445\\n\\nOnce the project outcomes are documented, you’ll request formal acceptance from the stake- holders or the customer. (We’ll look at formal acceptance later when we talk about the outputs.) They’re also interested in knowing if the product or service of the project meets the goals the project set out to accomplish. If your documentation is up-to-date, you’ll have the project results at hand to share with them.\\n\\nThe Close Project process is also concerned with analyzing the project management pro- cesses to determine their effectiveness and to document lessons learned concerning the project processes. And one of the other key functions of the Close Project process is the archiving of all project documents for historical reference. You can probably guess that Close Project belongs to the Project Integration Management knowledge area since this process touches so many areas of the project.\\n\\nEvery project requires closure. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the completion of each\\n\\nproject phase requires project closure as well.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nProject closure occurs at the end of each phase of the project in order to properly document project information and keep it safe for future reference. You shouldn’t wait until project com- pletion to perform the Close Project process but rather perform it at the end of every phase, no matter if the project phase was completed successfully or was ended for some other reason.\\n\\nClose Project Inputs\\n\\nThe Close Project process gathers all the project records and verifies that they are up-to-date and accurate. The project records must correctly identify the final specifications of the product or service the project set out to produce. Close Project is the place to ensure that this informa- tion accurately reflects the true results of the project.\\n\\nThe six inputs to the Close Project process are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management plan\\n\\nContract documentation\\n\\nEnterprise environmental factors\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets\\n\\n(cid:2) Work performance information\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nDeliverables\\n\\nWe’ve talked about all of these inputs with the exception of contract documentation. Con- tract documentation includes the contract and any other information, like contract changes, product descriptions, technical specifications, and so on.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 446  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n446\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nClose Project Tools and Techniques\\n\\nYou’ve seen all of the tools and techniques of Close Project in other processes:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProject management methodology\\n\\nProject management information system (PMIS)\\n\\nExpert judgment\\n\\nThe project management methodology should outline processes for both project and admin-\\n\\nistrative closeout. The PMIS and expert judgment are used to perform these processes.\\n\\nClose Project Outputs\\n\\nSometimes you’ll work on projects where everything just clicks. Your project team functions at the performing stage, the customers and stakeholders are happy, and things just fall into place according to plan. I often find it difficult to close projects that have progressed particularly well, just because I don’t want them to end. Believe it or not, the majority of your projects can fall into this category if you practice good project management techniques and exercise those great communication skills.\\n\\nThe Close Project process has the following outputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nAdministrative closure procedure\\n\\nContract closure procedure\\n\\nFinal product, service, or result\\n\\n(cid:2) Organizational process assets updates\\n\\nLet’s take a brief look at each.\\n\\nAdministrative Closure Procedure\\n\\nAdministrative closure procedures involves collecting all the records associated with the project, analyzing the project success (or failure), documenting and gathering lessons learned, and archiving project records. Keep in mind that when projects are performed under contract, the archiving of financial records is especially important. These records may need to be accessed if there are payment disputes, so you need to know where they are and how they were filed. Projects with large financial expenditures also require particular attention to the archiving of financial records for the same rea- sons. Financial information is especially useful when estimating future projects, so again, make sure to archive the information so it’s easily accessible.\\n\\nAll of these documents should be indexed for reference and filed in a safe place. Don’t forget\\n\\nto include electronic databases and electronic documents as part of your project archives as well. These records can be stored on a network drive or copied onto a CD that’s kept with the project binder.\\n\\nAdministrative closure procedures also document the project team members’ and stakehold- ers’ roles and responsibilities in performing this process. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, this should include the processes and methodologies for defining the following:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nApproval requirements of the stakeholders for project deliverables and changes to deliverables.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 447  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nClosing Out the Project\\n\\n447\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nAssuring and confirming that the project meets the requirements of the stakeholders, cus- tomers, and sponsor. Documenting necessary actions to verify that the deliverables have been accepted and exit criteria have been met.\\n\\nAssuring and confirming that the exit criteria for the project is satisfied.\\n\\nContract Closure Procedure\\n\\nContract closure procedures, like the administrative closure procedures, document the roles and responsibilities of the project team members and stakeholders in closing out the contract. This pro- cedure details the methodology you use to assure that contract exit criteria and contract conditions have been satisfied. We’ll talk more about contract closure in the section “Contract Closure.”\\n\\nFinal Product, Service, or Result\\n\\nThe name of this output is somewhat misleading. This actually refers to the acceptance of the final product, service, or result and the turnover of the product to the organization. This usually requires a formal sign-off (we’ll talk about that next) and, in the case of a project performed on contract, definitely requires a formal sign-off or receipt indicating acceptance of the project.\\n\\nFormal acceptance includes distributing notice of the acceptance of the product or service of the project by the stakeholders, customer, or project sponsor to stakeholders and customers. You should require formal sign-off indicating that those signing accept the product of the project.\\n\\nThe final product, service, or result is concerned with obtaining formal accep- tance while organizational process assets involves documenting and archiving formal acceptance.\\n\\nOrganizational Process Assets Updates\\n\\nThe organizational process assets output is where the formal sign-off of the acceptance of the product is documented, collected, and archived for future reference. Documenting formal acceptance is important because it signals the official closure of the project and it is your proof that the project was completed satisfactorily.\\n\\nAnother function of sign-off is that it kicks off the beginning of the warranty period. Sometimes project managers or vendors will warranty their work for a certain time period after completing the project. Projects that produce software programs, for example, may be warranted from bugs for a 60- or 90-day time frame from the date of implementation or acceptance. Typically in the case of software projects, bugs are fixed for free during the warranty period. Watch out, because users will try to squeeze new requirements into the “bug” category mold. If you offer a warranty, it’s critical that the warranty spells out exactly what is covered and what is not.\\n\\nThis is also where the other project records and files are collected and archived. This includes\\n\\nthe project planning documents (project scope statement, budget, schedule, risk responses, quality plan and baselines, and so on), change records and logs, issue logs, and so on.\\n\\nProject closure documents are included in this output. These include documentation showing\\n\\nthe transfer of the product of the project to the organization (or department responsible for\\n\\n3601.book  Page 448  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n448\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nongoing maintenance and support). If your project is canceled or ends prematurely, you should document the reasons for its premature end as well as the procedures for transferring the com- pleted and uncompleted deliverables.\\n\\nLessons learned are used to document the successes and failures of the project. As an example,\\n\\nlessons learned document the reasons why specific corrective actions were taken, their out- comes, the causes of performance variances, unplanned risks that occurred, mistakes that were made and could have been avoided, and so on.\\n\\nUnfortunately, sometimes projects do fail. There are things that can be learned from failed\\n\\nprojects as well as from successful projects, and this information should be documented for future reference. Most project managers, however, do not document lessons learned. The rea- son for this is that employees don’t want to admit to making mistakes or learning from mistakes made during the project. And they do not want their name associated with failed projects or even with mishaps on successful projects.\\n\\nLessons learned can be some of the most valuable information you’ll take away from a project. We can all learn from our experiences, and what better way to have even more success on your next project than to review a similar past project’s lessons learned document? But lessons learned will only be there if you document them now. I strongly recommend you not skip this step.\\n\\nYou and your management team will have to work to create an atmosphere of trust and assurance that lessons learned are not reasons for dismissing employees but are learning oppor- tunities that benefit all those associated with the project. Lessons learned allow you to carry knowledge gained on this project to other projects you’ll work on going forward. They’ll also prevent repeat mistakes in the future if you take the time to review the project documents and lessons learned prior to undertaking your new project.\\n\\nPost-implementation audits aren’t an official output, but they are a good idea. These go hand in hand with lessons learned because they examine the project from beginning to end and look at what went right and what went wrong. They evaluate the project goals and determine if the prod- uct or service of the project satisfies the objectives. Post-implementation audits also examine the activities and project processes to determine if improvements are possible on future projects.\\n\\nOrganizations that do not document lessons learned probably do conduct post-implementation audits. Documenting and gathering information during this procedure can serve the same function as lessons learned if you’re honest and include all the good, the bad, and the ugly. Let’s hope there’s very little ugly.\\n\\nContract Closure\\n\\nContracts have life cycles of their own—just like projects. We talked about the contract life cycles in Chapter 9, “Measuring and Controlling Project Performance.” As such, contracts come to a close just as projects come to a close. As you might guess, there is a process that deals with contract closings; it’s called Contract Closure.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 449  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nContract Closure\\n\\n449\\n\\nCimarron Research Group\\n\\nThe Cimarron Research Group researches and develops organic pesticides for use on food crops. It is a medium-sized company and has established a project management office (PMO) to manage all aspects of project work. The PMO consists of project managers and administra- tive staff who assist with information handling, filing, and disbursement.\\n\\nTerri Roberts is the project manager for a project that has just closed. Terri diligently filed all the pertinent project documents as the project progressed and has requested the research files and engineering notes from the director of engineering to include them with the project archives as well. All information regarding the research on this project is included with the project archives. The engineering department chooses to keep their own set of research records as well, but it’s important to keep a copy of these notes with the project archives so that all the information about the project is located in one place.\\n\\nTerri’s assistant has indexed all the project documents and recently sent notice of formal acceptance and approval of this project to the stakeholders, project sponsor, and management team. This notice officially closes the project. The next step is to archive the files onto CDs and store them.\\n\\nThe Contract Closure process is concerned with completing and settling the terms of the con- tract. It supports the Close Project process because the Contract Closure process determines if the work described in the contract was completed accurately and satisfactorily. This is called product verification. Projects that have multiple deliverables may have contracts for some of the deliverables but not all. Obviously, this process applies only to those phases, deliverables, or portions of the project that were performed under contract.\\n\\nContract Closure updates records and archives the information for future reference. These records detail the final results of the work of the project. We’ll look at the specifics of this when we examine the Contract Closure outputs.\\n\\nContracts may have specific terms or conditions for completion and closeout. You should be aware of these terms or conditions so that project closure isn’t held up because you missed an important detail. If you are not administering the contract yourself, be certain to ask your pro- curement department if there are any special conditions that you should know about so that your project team doesn’t inadvertently delay contract or project closure.\\n\\nClose Project verifies and documents the project outcomes just like the Con- tract Closure process. Keep in mind that not all projects are performed under contract so not all projects require Contract Closure. However, all projects do require the Close Project process. Since verification and documentation of the project outcomes occur in both of these processes, projects that are performed under contract need to have project results verified only one time.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 450  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n450\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nFor the exam, remember that product verification performed during the Closing processes determines if all of the work of the project was completed correctly according to the contract terms and satisfactorily according to stakeholder expectations whereas product documenta- tion is verified and accepted during the Scope Verification process. One more note: When projects end prematurely, the Scope Verification process is where the level of detail concerning the amount of work completed gets documented.\\n\\nContract Closure Inputs\\n\\nThe Contract Closure process has four inputs:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nProcurement management plan\\n\\nContract management plan\\n\\nContract documentation\\n\\nContract Closure procedures\\n\\nWe’ve discussed all these inputs before, but there’s a few more things you should know about contract documentation for this process. Contract documentation includes the contract itself and all the supporting documents that go along with it. These might include things such as the WBS, the project schedule, change control documents, technical documents, financial and pay- ment records, quality control inspection results, and so on. This information—along with all the other information gathered during the project—is filed once the project is closed out so that anyone considering a future project of similar scope can reference what was done.\\n\\nContract documentation is an input to both the Close Project and Contract Clo- sure processes.\\n\\nContract Closure Tools and Techniques\\n\\nThe Contract Closure process has two tools and techniques: procurement audits and records management system. The records management system here serves the same function as the records management system we talked about in the discussion of the Contract Administration process in Chapter 9. Procurement audits are reviews of procurement processes to determine if they are meeting the right needs and are being performed correctly and according to standards. A Guide to the PMBOK says procurement audits are concerned with reviewing the procure- ment process, starting with the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process all the way through Contract Administration.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 451  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nContract Closure\\n\\n451\\n\\nThe primary purpose of the procurement audit is to identify lessons learned during the pro- curement process. Procurement audits examine the procurement process to determine areas of improvement and to identify flawed processes or procedures. This allows you to reuse the suc- cessful processes on other procurement items for this project, on future projects, or elsewhere in the organization. It also alerts you to problems in the process so that you don’t repeat them. Procurement audits may be used by either the buyer or the vendor, or by both, as an oppor- tunity for improvement. Documenting the lessons learned—including the successes and failures that occurred—allows you to improve other procurement processes currently under way on this project or other projects. It also gives you the opportunity to improve the process for future projects.\\n\\nContract Closure Outputs\\n\\nOne of the purposes of the Contract Closure process is to provide formal notice to the seller— usually in written form—that the contract is complete. The output of Contract Closure that deals with this is called closed contracts. This is formal acceptance and closure of the contract. It’s your responsibility as project manager to document the formal acceptance of the contract. Many times the provisions for formalizing acceptance and closing the contract are spelled out in the contract itself.\\n\\nIf you have a procurement department that handles contract administration, they will expect\\n\\nyou to inform them when the contract is completed and will in turn follow the formal proce- dures to let the seller know the contract is complete. However, you’ll still note the contract com- pletion in your copy of the project records.\\n\\nDepending on the terms of the contract, early termination (whether by agree- ment, default, or for cause) may result in additional charges to the buyer. Be cer- tain to note the reasons for early termination in your contract documentation.\\n\\nThe other output of Contract Closure is organizational process updates. This includes updat- ing the contract file, deliverables acceptance, and lessons learned. The contract file is simply a file of all the contract records and supporting documents. These records should be indexed for easy reference and included as part of the project files in the Close Project process.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK shows the Close Project process being performed before the Contract Closure process. In practice, you will likely close out the contract before closing the project and archiving project documents. Note that the contract file (part of the organizational process assets update) output of the Contract Closure process is an input to the Close Project process (called contract documentation).\\n\\n3601.book  Page 452  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n452\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nThis process is your organization’s way of formally accepting the product of the project from\\n\\nthe vendor and closing out the contract. The deliverable acceptance portion of the organiza- tional process updates includes the formal written notice from the buyer that the deliverables are acceptable and satisfactory or have been rejected. If the product or service does not meet expectations, the vendor will need to correct the problems before you issue a formal acceptance notice. Hopefully, quality audits have been performed during the course of the project and the vendor was given the opportunity to make corrections earlier in the process than the Closing stage. It’s not a good idea to wait until the very end of the project and then spring all the prob- lems and issues on the vendor at once. It’s much more efficient to discuss problems with your vendor as the project progresses because it provides the opportunity for correction when the problems occur.\\n\\nLessons learned include information and documentation about what worked well and what didn’t work well regarding the procurement processes. This information can be used on future projects to improve performance and prevent inefficiencies.\\n\\nReleasing Project Team Members\\n\\nReleasing project team members is not an official process. However, it should be noted that at the conclusion of the project, you will release your project team members, and they will go back to their functional managers or get assigned to a new project if you’re working in a matrix type organization.\\n\\nYou will want to keep the functional managers or other project managers informed as you get closer to project completion so that they have time to adequately plan for the return of their employees. Start letting them know a few months ahead of time what the schedule looks like and how soon they can plan on using their employees on new projects. This gives the other man- agers the ability to start planning activities and scheduling activity dates.\\n\\nCelebrate!\\n\\nI think it’s a good idea to hold a celebration at the conclusion of a successfully completed project. The project team should celebrate their accomplishment, and you should officially rec- ognize their efforts and thank them for their participation. Any number of ideas come to mind here—a party, a trip to a ball game, pizza and sodas at lunch time, and so on. This shouldn’t be the only time you’ve recognized your team, as discussed during the Team Development pro- cess, but now is the time to officially close the project and thank your team members.\\n\\nA celebration helps team members formally recognize the project end and brings closure to the work they’ve done. It also encourages them to remember what they’ve learned and to start thinking about how their experiences will benefit them and the organization during the next project.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 453  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nReleasing Project Team Members\\n\\n453\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nDirk strolls into your office maintaining his formal and dignified manners as always and then sits down in the chair beside your desk.\\n\\n“I just want to congratulate you on a job well done,” he says. “The grand opening was a suc- cess, and the store had a better-than-expected week the first week. I’m impressed you were able to pull this off and get the store opened prior to the Garden and Home Show. That was the key to the great opening week.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Dirk. Lots of people put in a lot of hard work and extra hours to get this job done. I’m glad you’re happy with the results.”\\n\\n“I thought the banner with our logo, ‘Great Gadgets for People Interested in Great Food,’ was a wonderful touch.”\\n\\n“That was Jill’s idea. She had some great ideas that made the festivities successful. As you know, though,” you continue, “we did have some problems on this project. Fortunately, they weren’t insurmountable, but I think we learned a thing or two during this project that we can carry forward to other projects.”\\n\\n“Like what?” Dirk asks.\\n\\n“We should have contracted with Gomez Construction sooner so that we didn’t have to pay overtime. We had a very generous budget, so the overtime expense didn’t impact this project, but it might impact the next one.\\n\\n“And we came fairly close to having a hardware disaster on our hands. Next time, we should order the equipment sooner, test it here at headquarters first, and then ship it out to the site after we know everything is working correctly.”\\n\\n“Good ideas. But that’s old news. Now that this project is over, I’d like to get you started on the next project. We’re going to introduce cooking classes in all of our retail stores. The focus is the home chef, and we might just call the classes the Home Chef Pro series. We’ll offer basic classes all the way to professional series classes if the project’s a hit. We’ll bring in guest chefs from the local areas to give demos and teach some of the classes as well.”\\n\\n“I’m very interested in taking on this project and can’t wait to get started. I’m thrilled that you want me to head this up. But I do have a few things here to wrap up before I start work on the new project,” you reply.\\n\\nDirk says, “The project’s over. The grand opening was a success. It’s time to move on. Let Jill take over now; the retail stores are her responsibility.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 454  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n454\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\n“Jill has taken over the day-to-day operations. However, I’ve got to finish collecting the project information, close out the contract with Gomez, and make the final payment. Jake verified that all the work was completed correctly and to his satisfaction. Then I need to publish the formal acceptance notice to all of the stakeholders via e-mail. I will also create a document that out- lines those things I told you earlier about that we should remember and reference during the next project; that document is called lessons learned. Then after all those things are completed, all of the project records need to be indexed and archived. I can have all that done by the end of the week and will be free starting Monday to work on requirements gathering and the charter document for the new project.”\\n\\n“This is just like the planning process discussion we got into with the tree, the breakdown struc- ture thing, and all the planning, I suspect. I do have to admit all the planning paid off. I’ll give you until the end of the week to close out this project. Come see me Monday to get started on Home Chef Pro.”\\n\\nProject Case Study Checklist\\n\\nScope Verification\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nVerified work results\\n\\nPerform Quality Control\\n\\nAssured quality requirements were met\\n\\nClose Project\\n\\nProduct verification (work was correct and satisfactory)\\n\\nCollecting project documents\\n\\nDisseminating final acceptance notice\\n\\nDocumenting lessons learned\\n\\nArchiving project records\\n\\nContract Closure\\n\\nProduct verification (work was correct and satisfactory)\\n\\nFormal acceptance and closure\\n\\n3601.book  Page 455  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n455\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWe closed out the Monitoring and Controlling process group with this chapter by covering the Perform Quality Control, Scope Verification, and Scope Control processes.\\n\\nPerform Quality Control monitors work results to see if they fulfill the quality standards outlined\\n\\nin the quality management plan. Perform Quality Control should occur throughout the life of the project. It uses many tools and techniques. Inspection measures results to determine if the results con- form to the quality standards. Attributes are measurements that either conform or do not conform. Control charts measure the results of processes over time, and Pareto charts are histograms that rank- order the most important quality factors by their frequency over time. You should not adjust pro- cesses that are in control; however, you can change these processes to realize improvements.\\n\\nScope Verification involves verifying and accepting work results, while Scope Control is con-\\n\\ncerned with controlling changes to project scope.\\n\\nProject closure is the most often neglected process of all the project management processes. The two processes in the Closing process group are Close Project and Contract Closure. The four most important tasks of closure are as follows:\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\n(cid:2)\\n\\nChecking the work for completeness and accuracy\\n\\nDocumenting formal acceptance\\n\\nDisseminating project closure information\\n\\nArchiving records and lessons learned\\n\\nClose Project involves checking that the work of the project was completed correctly and to\\n\\nthe satisfaction of the stakeholders. Documenting formal acceptance of the product of the project is an important aspect of project closure as well. This assures that the stakeholder or cus- tomer is satisfied with the work and that it meets their needs.\\n\\nProjects come to an end in one of four ways: addition, starvation, integration, or extinction. Addition is when projects evolve into their own business unit. Starvation happens because the project is starved of its resources. Integration occurs when resources are taken from the existing project and dispersed back into the organization or assigned to other projects. And extinction is the best end because the project was completed, accepted, and closed.\\n\\nClose Project is performed at the end of each phase of the project as well as at the end of the project. Close Project involves documenting formal acceptance and disseminating notice of accep- tance to the stakeholders, customer, and others. All documentation gathered during the project and collected during this process is archived and saved for reference purposes on future projects. Contract Closure is performed after Close Project and is concerned with settling the contract and completing the contract according to its terms. Its primary outputs include the contract file and for- mal acceptance and closure (both are components of the organizational process assets update).\\n\\n3601.book  Page 456  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n456\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\nLessons learned document the successes and failures of the project and of the procurement pro- cesses. Many times lessons learned are not documented because staff members do not want to assign their names to project errors or failures. You and your management team need to work together to assure employees that lessons learned are not exercises used for disciplinary purposes but benefit both the employee and the organization. Documenting what you’ve learned from past experiences lets you carry this forward to new projects so that the same errors are not repeated. It also allows you to incor- porate new methods of performing activities that you learned on past projects.\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to name the tools and techniques of Perform Quality Control. The tools and tech- niques of the of Perform Quality Control process are cause-and-effect diagram, control charts, flowcharting, histogram, Pareto chart, run chart, scatter diagram, statistical sampling, inspec- tion, and defect repair review.\\n\\nName the purpose of the Scope Verification process. The purpose of Scope Verification is to determine if the work is complete and if it satisfies the project objectives.\\n\\nBe able to name the purpose of the Closing processes. The purpose of the Closing processes is to verify that the work was satisfactorily completed, to disseminate information, to document formal acceptance, to archive records, to close out the contract, and to document lessons learned.\\n\\nBe able to describe product verification. Product verification confirms that all the work of the project performed on contract was completed accurately and to the satisfaction of the stakeholder.\\n\\nBe able to name the primary activity of the Closing processes. The primary activity of the Closing processes is to distribute information that formalizes project completion.\\n\\nBe able to describe when the Close Project process is performed. Close Project is performed at the close of each project phase and at the close of the project.\\n\\nBe able to define the purpose for lessons learned. The purpose of lessons learned is to describe the project successes and failures and to use the information learned on future projects.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 457  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\n457\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

This is an input to the Close Project process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 464  Wednesday, July 13, 2005  1:39 PM\\n\\n464\\n\\nChapter 11 (cid:2) Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project\\n\\n16. A. Lessons learned document the experiences, successes, and failures that occurred during this project for future reference. There isn’t enough information in the question to determine if option B or D is correct. Option C is not correct because the project was completed.\\n\\n17. C. Product verification involves examining the work of the project for completeness and cor-\\n\\nrectness. This process occurs on the existing project and isn’t of much benefit to future projects because you’ll perform product verification on future project work at the close of the project. By definition, a project is unique and creates a unique product or service.\\n\\n18. C. Post-implementation audits are similar to lessons learned in that they review and document the project successes and failures, look for possible improvements for future projects, and eval- uate the project goals and compare these to the end product.\\n\\n19. D. Procurement audits are a tool and technique of Contract Closure and not an input. Contract documentation might include all of the other options shown as well as the contract itself, tech- nical documentation, quality inspection reports related to the contract, and so on.\\n\\n20. A. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the procurement audit examines the procurement process\\n\\nfrom Procurement Planning through Contract Administration.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 465  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nChapter\\n\\n12\\n\\nProfessional\\n\\nResponsibility\\n\\nTHE PMP EXAM CONTENT FROM THE PRO- FESSIONAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE DOMAIN COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\nEnsure Individual Integrity\\n\\nContribute to the Project Management Knowledge Base\\n\\nEnhance Personal Professional Competence\\n\\nPromote Interaction Among Stakeholders\\n\\n3601.book  Page 466  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nCongratulations! You’ve made terrific progress and are well equipped to take the Project Management Professional (PMP) exam. We’ve covered all of\\n\\nA Guide to the PMBOK\\n\\nprocess\\n\\ngroups, so the good news is you don’t have any more inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, or formulas to memorize. However, there is one final area that the PMP exam will include: pro- fessional responsibility.\\n\\nOnce you’ve obtained the PMP designation, you have an obligation to maintain integrity, apply your subject matter knowledge and project management knowledge, and maintain the code of conduct published by PMI. You’ll also be required to balance the interests and needs of stake- holders with the organization’s needs. The exam may include questions on any of these topics.\\n\\nAs a project manager, you’ll find yourself in many unique situations, different organizations,\\n\\nand possibly even different countries. Even if you never get involved in international project management, you will still come in contact with people from different cultures and back- grounds than yours. If you work as a contract project manager, you’ll be exposed to many dif- ferent organizations that each has its own cultures and ways of doing things. You should always strive to act in a professional, nonoffensive manner in these situations.\\n\\nWe’ll talk about each of these topics in this chapter.\\n\\nEnsuring Integrity\\n\\nAs a project manager, one of your professional responsibilities is to ensure integrity of the project management process, the product, and your own personal conduct. We’ve spent the majority of this book discussing how to achieve project management integrity by following the project man- agement processes. Now we’ll turn our focus to accurately ensuring the integrity of the product.\\n\\nA product that has integrity is one that is complete and sound, or fit for use.\\n\\nThe correct application of the project management processes you’ve learned will ensure the\\n\\nintegrity of the product. The effective execution of the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring and Controlling processes, including documenting scope, performing quality inspections, mea- suring performance, and taking corrective actions, will ensure that a quality product is pro- duced that satisfies the requirements of the stakeholders (and the project plan). And as you learned in the Chapter 11, you will seek acceptance of the product from the stakeholders and customer during the Closing process group.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 467  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nEnsuring Integrity\\n\\n467\\n\\nThere are several facets of integrity including personal integrity, avoiding conflict of interest\\n\\nsituations, and professionalism. We’ll look at each of these next.\\n\\nPersonal Integrity\\n\\nPersonal integrity means sticking to an ethical code. As a certified Project Management Profes- Project Management Professional Code of Profes- sional, you are required to adhere to PMI’s sional Conduct.\\n\\nYou can find a copy of this code at the PMI website:\\n\\nwww.pmi.org\\n\\n.\\n\\nYou should read and understand this code because you will be agreeing to adhere to its terms as part of the certification process. One of the aspects of personal integrity includes your truth- fulness about your PMP application and certification, your qualifications, and the continuing reports you provide to PMI to maintain your certification.\\n\\nExam Spotlight\\n\\nI recommend reading the\\n\\nment studies.\\n\\nPMP Code of Professional Conduct\\n\\nas part of your project manage-\\n\\nTruthfulness and integrity involve not only information regarding your own background and experience, but information regarding the project circumstances as well. For example, let’s say you’re a project manager working on contract. Part of your compensation consists of a bonus based on total project billing. Now let’s suppose your project is finishing sooner than anticipated, and this means your personal profit will decrease by $1,500. Should you stretch the work to meet the original contracted amount so that your personal bonus comes in at the full amount even though your project team is finished? I think you know the answer is of course not. Your personal gain should never be a consideration when billing a customer or completing a project. Personal gain should never be a factor in any project decision. If the project finishes sooner than planned, you should bill the customer for the work completed, not for the full con- tracted amount. Compromising the project for the sake of your personal gain shows a lack of integrity, which could ultimately cost you your PMP status and even your job.\\n\\nConflict of Interest\\n\\nPMP Code of Professional Conduct\\n\\ndiscusses is your responsibility to report Another area the to the stakeholders, customers, or others any actions or circumstances that could be construed as a\\n\\nconflict of interest.\\n\\nA conflict of interest is when your personal interests are put above the interests of the project or when you use your influence to cause others to make decisions in your favor without regard for the project outcome. In other words, your personal interests take precedence over your pro- fessional obligations, and you make decisions that allow you to personally benefit regardless of the outcome of the project. Let’s take a look at a few examples.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 468  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n468\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2)\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\nAssociations and Affiliations\\n\\nConflicts of interest may include your associations or affiliations. For example, perhaps your brother-in-law owns his own construction company and you are the project manager for a con- struction project that’s just published an RFP. Your brother-in-law bids on the project and ends up winning the bid.\\n\\nIf you sat on the decision committee and didn’t tell anyone about your association with the winning bidder, that is clearly a conflict of interest. If you influenced the bid decision so that it went to your brother-in-law, he benefited from your position. Therefore, you put your personal interests, or in this case the interests of your associations, above the project outcome. Even if you did not influence the decision in any way, when others on the project discover the winning bidder is your brother-in-law, they will assume a conflict of interest occurred. This could jeop- ardize the awarding of the bid and your own position as well.\\n\\nThe correct thing to do in this case would be to, first, inform the project sponsor and the deci- sion committee that your brother-in-law intends to bid on the project. Second, refrain from par- ticipating on the award decision committee so as not to unduly influence others in favor of your brother-in-law. And last, if you’ve done all these things and your brother-in-law still wins the bid, appoint someone else in your organization to administer the contract and make the pay- ments for the work performed by him. Also, make certain you document the decisions you make regarding the activities performed by him and keep them with the project files. The more doc- umentation you have, the less likely someone can make a conflict of interest accusation stick.\\n\\nVendor Gifts\\n\\nMany professionals work in situations in which they are not allowed to accept gifts in excess of certain dollar amounts. This might be driven by company policy, the department manager’s pol- icy, and so on. In my organization, it’s considered a conflict of interest to accept anything from a vendor, including gifts (no matter how small), meals, even a cup of coffee. Vendors and suppliers often provide their customers and potential customers with lunches, gifts, ballgame tickets, and the like. It’s your responsibility to know if a policy exists that forbids you from accepting these gifts. It’s also your responsibility to inform the vendor if they’ve gone over the limit and you are unable to accept the gift.\\n\\nThe same situation can occur here as with the brother-in-law example earlier. If you accept an expensive gift from a vendor and later award that vendor a contract or a piece of the project work, it looks like and probably is a conflict of interest. This violates PMI guidelines and doesn’t look good for you personally either.\\n\\nUsing the “I didn’t know there was a policy” reasoning probably won’t save you when there’s a question of conflict of interest. Make it your business to find out if the organization has a conflict of interest policy and understand exactly what it says. Get a copy and keep it with your files. Review it periodically. Put a note on your calendar every six months to reread the policy to keep it fresh in your mind. This is a case where not knowing what you don’t know can hurt you.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 469  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nEnsuring Integrity\\n\\n469\\n\\nDon’t accept gifts that might be construed as a conflict of interest. If your organization does not have a policy regarding vendor gifts, set limits for yourself depending on the situation, the history of gift acceptance by the organization in the past, and the complexity of the project. It’s always better to decline a gift you’re unsure about than to accept it and later lose your credi- bility, your reputation, or your PMP status because of bad judgment.\\n\\nStakeholder Influence\\n\\nAnother potential area for conflict of interest comes from stakeholders. Stakeholders are usually folks with a good deal of authority and an important position in the company. Make certain you are not putting your own personal interests above the interests of the project when you’re deal- ing with powerful stakeholders. They may have the ability to promote you or reward you in other ways. That’s not a bad thing, but if you let that get in the way of the project or let a stake- holder twist your arm with promises like this, you’re getting mighty close to a conflict of inter- est. Always weigh your decisions with the objectives of the project and the organization in mind—not your own personal gain.\\n\\nKeep in mind that you may not always be on the receiving end of the spectrum. You should\\n\\nnot offer inappropriate gifts or services or use confidential information you have at your dis- posal to assist others because this can also be considered a conflict of interest.\\n\\nProfessional Demeanor\\n\\nActing in a professional manner is required of most everyone who works in the business world. While you are not responsible for the actions of others, you are responsible for your own actions and reactions. Part of acting professionally involves controlling yourself and your reactions in questionable situations. For example, a stakeholder or customer may lash out at you but have no basis for their outburst. You can’t control what they said or did, but you can control how you respond. As a professional, your concern for the project and the organization should take precedence over your concern for your own feelings. Therefore, lashing out in return would be unprofessional. Maintain your professional demeanor and don’t succumb to shouting matches or ego competitions with others.\\n\\nAs project manager, you have a good deal of influence over your project team members. One of the items on the agenda at the project team kickoff meeting should be a discussion of where the team members can find a copy of organizational policies regarding conflict of interest, cul- tural diversity, standards and regulations, and customer service and standards of performance. Better yet, have copies with you that you can hand out at the meeting or have available the addresses of website where they can find these documents.\\n\\nWhen you see project team members acting out of turn or with less-than-desirable customer service attitudes, coach and influence those team members to conform to the standards of con- duct expected by you and your organization. Your team members represent you and the project. As such, they should act professionally. It’s your job as the project leader to ensure that they do.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 470  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n470\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2)\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\nThe Golf Trip\\n\\nAmanda Lewis is a project manager for a network upgrade project for her organization. This project will be outsourced to a vendor. Amanda will manage the vendor’s work. She also wrote the RFP and is a member of the selection committee.\\n\\nThe project consists of converting the organization’s network from 100MB Ethernet to Gigabit Ethernet. This requires replacing all of the routers and switches. Some of the cabling in the buildings will need to be replaced as well. The RFP requires that the vendor who wins the bid install all the new equipment and replace the network interface cards in each of the servers with Gigabit Ethernet cards. The grand total for this project is estimated at $1.2 million.\\n\\nDon James is a vendor with whom Amanda has worked in the past. Don is very interested in winning this bid. He drops in on Amanda one day shortly after the RFP is posted.\\n\\n“Amanda, it’s good to see you,” Don says. “I was in the neighborhood and thought I’d stop in to see how things are going.”\\n\\n“Just great, Don,” Amanda replies. “I’ll bet you’re here to talk to me about that RFP. You know I can’t say anything until the whole process closes.”\\n\\n“You bet we bid on the project. I know you can’t talk about the RFP, so I won’t bring it up. I wanted to chat with you about something else. My company is sending 15 lucky contestants and one friend each to Scottsdale, Arizona, for a ‘conference.’ The conference includes the use of the Scottsdale Golf Club, green fees paid of course, and all hotel and meal expenses are on us for the length of the trip. I know Scottsdale is one of your favorite places to golf, so I thought of you. What do you say?”\\n\\nAmanda sits forward in her chair and looks at Don for a minute. “That sounds fabulous, and I do love Scottsdale. But you and I both know this isn’t a conference. I wouldn’t feel right about accepting it.”\\n\\n“Come on, Amanda. Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. It is a conference. I’ll be there and so will the top brass from the company. We have some presentations and demonstrations we’d like to show you while you’re there, no obligation of course, and then you’re free to spend the rest of the time however you’d like.”\\n\\n“I appreciate the offer. Thanks for thinking of me, but no thanks. I’m on the selection com- mittee for the RFP, and it would be a conflict of interest if I attended this conference. Besides, the value of the conference is over the $100 limit our company sets for vendor gifts and meals,” Amanda says.\\n\\n“Okay. We’ll miss you. Maybe next time.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 471  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nApplying Professional Knowledge\\n\\n471\\n\\nYou probably remember something your mother always told you: Actions speak louder than words. Always remember that you lead by example. Your team members are watching. If you are driven by high personal ethics and a strong desire to produce excellent customer service, those who work for you will likely follow your lead.\\n\\nApplying Professional Knowledge\\n\\nProfessional knowledge involves the knowledge of project management practices as well as spe- cific industry or technical knowledge required to complete an assignment.\\n\\nAs a PMP, you should apply project management knowledge to all your projects. Take the opportunity to educate others regarding project management practices by keeping others up-to- date on project management practices, training your team members to use the correct techniques, and informing stakeholders of the correct processes and then sticking to those processes through- out the course of the project. This isn’t always easy, especially when the organization doesn’t have any formal processes in place. But once the stakeholders see the benefits of good project manage- ment practices, they’ll never go back to the “old” way of performing their projects.\\n\\nOne way to apply professional knowledge is to become and remain knowledgeable in project management best practices techniques. We’ll look at this topic next along with a discussion of becoming a PMI education provider, and the impor- the tance of having industry knowledge.\\n\\nPMP Code of Professional Conduct,\\n\\nProject Management Knowledge\\n\\nProject management is a growing field. Part of your responsibility as a PMP is to stay abreast of project management practices, theories, and techniques. There are many ways to do this, one of which includes joining a local PMI chapter. There are hundreds of local chapters in every state ) to find a chapter and in other countries as well. You can check the PMI website ( near you.\\n\\nwww.pmi.org\\n\\nChapter meetings give you the opportunity to meet other project managers, find out what techniques they’re using, and seek advice regarding your project. Usually guest speakers appear at each chapter meeting and share their experiences and tips. Their stories are always interesting, and they give you the opportunity to learn from someone else’s experiences and avoid making wrong turns on your next project. You may have a few stories of your own worth sharing with your local chapter. Volunteer to be a speaker at an upcoming meeting and let others learn from your experiences.\\n\\nOne of the things you’ll get when you join the PMI organization and pay your yearly dues\\n\\nis their monthly magazine. This publication details real-life projects and the techniques and issues project managers have to deal with on those projects. Reading the magazine is a great way\\n\\n3601.book  Page 472  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n472\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2)\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\nto learn new project management techniques or reinforce the information you already know. You might discover how to apply some of the knowledge you’ve already learned in more effi- cient ways as well.\\n\\nPMI offers educational courses through their local chapters and at the national level as well. These are yet another way for you to learn about project management and meet others in your field. Next we’ll look your responsibility for accurately and honestly reporting the level of knowledge\\n\\nand qualifications you possess, what an education provider is, and why industry knowledge is important.\\n\\nProfessional Conduct\\n\\nWe talked about honesty earlier in this chapter, but it’s worth repeating: Don’t mislead others regarding your experience in the project management field. The Conduct performance of services to potential employers, customers, PMI, and others.\\n\\nrequires that you honestly report your qualifications, your experience, and your past\\n\\nPMP Code of Professional\\n\\nBe honest about what you know and what you don’t know. For example, the Quality are used extensively in the man- A Guide to the PMBOK Control processes as described in ufacturing industry. However, the information technology field looks at quality issues in different ways. If you’re a project manager in the information technology field, you’ve probably never used control charts and cause-and-effect diagramming techniques. Don’t lead others to believe that you have used techniques you haven’t used or that you have expe- rience you don’t have.\\n\\nEmphasize the knowledge you do have and how you’ve used it in your specific industry and\\n\\ndon’t try to fudge it with processes and techniques you’ve never used. Potential clients and employers would much rather work with you and provide training where you might need it than think they’ve got someone fully experienced with the project or industry techniques needed for a project when they don’t.\\n\\nIf you’re working on contract or you’re self-employed, you have a responsibility to ensure that the estimates you provide potential customers are accurate and truthful. Make certain you clearly spell out what services you’re providing and let the customer know the results they can expect at the end of the project. Accurately represent yourself, your qualifications, and your estimates in your advertising and in person.\\n\\nEducation Providers\\n\\nPMI has a program that allows you or your organization to become a Registered Education Pro- vider (R.E.P.). This allows you—once you’re certified—to conduct PMI-sanctioned project management training, seminars, and conferences. The best part is that your attendees are awarded professional development units (PDUs) for attending the training or seminar. As a PMP, and especially as an R.E.P., you have a responsibility to the profession and to PMI to pro- vide truthful information regarding the PMI certification process, the exam applications, PDU requirements, and so on. Keep up-to-date on PMI’s certification process by periodically check- ing the website.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 473  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nApplying Professional Knowledge\\n\\n473\\n\\nIndustry Knowledge\\n\\nContributing and applying professional knowledge goes beyond project management experi- ence. You likely have specific industry or technical experience as well. Part of applying your professional knowledge includes gaining knowledge of your particular industry and keeping others informed of advances in these areas.\\n\\nInformation technology has grown exponentially over the last several years. It used to be that if you specialized in network operations, for example, it was possible to learn and become proficient in all things related to networks. Today that is no longer the case. Each specialized area within infor- mation technology has grown to become a knowledge area in and of itself. Many other fields have either always had individual specialties or just recently experienced this phenomenon, including the medical field, bioengineering, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and so on. You need to stay up-to- date regarding your industry so that you can apply that knowledge effectively. Today’s fast-paced advances can leave you behind fairly quickly if you don’t stay on top of things.\\n\\nI mentioned in the beginning of the book that as a project manager you are not required to\\n\\nbe a technical expert, and that still holds true. But it doesn’t hurt to stay abreast of industry trends and knowledge in your field and have a general understanding of the specifics of your business. Again, you can join industry associations and take educational classes to stay on top of breaking trends and technology in your industry.\\n\\nTruthful Reporting\\n\\nAs a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information in your pos- session to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public. Always be up front regarding the project’s progress.\\n\\nNothing good will come of telling stakeholders or customers that the project is on track and everything looks great when in fact the project’s behind schedule or several unplanned risks have occurred that have thrown the project team a curveball. I’ve personally witnessed the demise of the careers of project man- agers who chose this route.\\n\\nTell the truth regarding project status, even when things don’t look good. Stakeholders will\\n\\nlikely go to great lengths to help you solve problems or brainstorm solutions. Sometimes, though, the call needs to be made to kill the project. This decision is usually made by the project sponsor and/or the stakeholders based on your recommendation and predictions of future project activities. Don’t skew the reporting to prevent stakeholders from making this decision when it is the best solution based on the circumstances.\\n\\nTruthful reporting is required when working with the public as well. When working in sit- uations where the public is at risk, truthfully report the facts of the situation and what steps you’re taking to counteract or reduce the threats. I recommend you get approval from the orga- nization regarding public announcements prior to reporting the facts. Many organizations have public relations departments that will handle this situation for you.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 474  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n474\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2)\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\nLaws and Regulations Compliance\\n\\nThis may seem obvious, but since it’s part of the we’ll men- tion it here. As a professional, you’re required to follow all applicable laws and rules and regula- tions that apply to your industry, organization, or project. This includes PMI organizational rules and policies as well. You should also follow any ethical standards and principles that may govern your industry or the state or country you’re working in. Remember that rules or regulations you’re used to in the United States may or may not apply to other countries and vice versa.\\n\\nPMP Code of Professional Conduct,\\n\\nAs a PMP, one of the responsibilities that falls into this category is the responsibility to report violations of the PMP code of conduct. In order to maintain integrity of the profession, PMPs must adhere to the code of conduct that makes all of us accountable to each other.\\n\\nWhen you know a violation has occurred and you’ve verified the facts, notify PMI. Part of this process—and a requirement of the code of conduct—is that you’ll comply with ethics vio- lations and will assist PMI in the investigation by supplying information, confirming facts and PMP Code of Professional Conduct, dates, and so on. Violations include anything listed in the such as conflicts of interest, untruthful advertising and reporting of PMP experience and cre- dentials, and so on, as well as appearances of impropriety. This one calls for some judgment on your part, but it’s mostly based on common sense. For example, a PMP in most situations should not have a family member working on the project team reporting to them (unless they own and run a family business).\\n\\nConfidential Information\\n\\nMany project managers work for consulting firms where their services are contracted out to organizations that need their expertise for particular projects. If you work in a situation like this, you will likely come across information that is sensitive or confidential. Again, this may you agree not to disclose seem obvious, but as part of the sensitive or confidential information or use it in any way for personal gain.\\n\\nPMP Code of Professional Conduct,\\n\\nOften when you work under contract, you’ll be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement.\\n\\nThis agreement simply says that you will not share information regarding the project or the organization with anyone—including the organization’s competitors—or use the information for your personal gain.\\n\\nHowever, you don’t have to work on contract to come into contact with sensitive or private information. You may work full-time for an organization or a government agency that deals with information regarding its customer base or citizens. For example, if you work for a bank, you may have access to personal account information. If you work for a government agency, you may have access to personal tax records or other sensitive material. It would be highly unethical and maybe even illegal to look up the account information of individuals not associated with the project at hand just to satisfy your own curiosity. In my organization, that is grounds for dismissal.\\n\\nDon’t compromise your ethics or your organization’s reputation by sharing information that is confidential to the organization or would jeopardize an indi- vidual’s privacy.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 475  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nBalancing Stakeholders’ Interests\\n\\n475\\n\\nCompany Data\\n\\nWhile it may seem obvious that you should not use personal information or an organization’s trade secrets for personal gain, sometimes the organization has a legitimate need to share infor- mation with vendors, governmental agencies, or others. You need to determine which vendors or organizations are allowed to see sensitive company data. In some cases, you may even need to determine which individuals can have access to the data. When in doubt, ask.\\n\\nHere are some examples. Maybe the company you’re working with has periodic mailings it sends to its customer base. If one of your project activities includes finding a new vendor to print the mailing labels, your organization may require the vendor to sign a nondisclosure agreement to guard the contents of the customer lists. Discovering just who should have access to this information might be tricky.\\n\\nAnother example involves data on citizens that is maintained by the government. You might think that because the data belongs to one agency of the government—say the Internal Revenue Service—any other agency of the government can have access to it. This isn’t the case. Some agencies are refused access to the data even though they may have good reason to use it. Others may have restricted access, depending on the data and the agency policy regarding it. Don’t assume that others should have access to data because it seems logical.\\n\\nMost organizations require vendors or other organizations to sign nondisclosure agreements when the vendors or others will have access to sensitive company data. It’s your responsibility to ensure that the proper nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to releasing the data. This function is often handled by the procurement department.\\n\\nIntellectual Property\\n\\nYou are likely to come into contact with intellectual property during the course of your project management career. Intellectual property includes items developed by an organization that have commercial value but are not tangible and copyrighted material such as books, software, and artistic works. It may also include ideas or processes that are patented. Or it might involve an industrial process, business process, or manufacturing process that was developed by the orga- nization for a specific purpose.\\n\\nIntellectual property is owned by the business or person that created it. You may have to pay\\n\\nroyalties or ask for written permission to use the property. Intellectual property should be treated just like sensitive or confidential data. It should not be used for personal gain or shared with others who should not have access to it.\\n\\nBalancing Stakeholders’ Interests\\n\\nProjects are undertaken at the request of customers, project sponsors, executive managers, and others. Stakeholders are those who have something to gain or lose by implementing the project. As such, stakeholders have different interests and needs, and one of your jobs is to balance the needs of the stakeholders.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 476  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n476\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2)\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\nCustomer satisfaction is probably the primary goal you’re striving for in any project. If your customer is satisfied, it means you’ve met or exceeded their expectations and delivered the product or service they were expecting. You’ve got a winning combination when the customer is satisfied with the product, and you’ve also provided excellent customer service along the way. Satisfied cus- tomers tell others about your success and will most likely use your services in the future.\\n\\nOne of the key ways to assure that customer satisfaction is achieved is to apply appropriate project management techniques to your project. This includes taking the time to discover all the requirements of the project and documenting them in the scope statement. You will find that stakeholders who have a clear understanding of the requirements and have signed off on them included” tech- won’t suffer from faulty memory and pull the ever famous “I thought that nique. Take the time to define your requirements and get stakeholder sign-off. You can’t forget or fudge what’s written down.\\n\\nwas\\n\\nIn the following sections we’ll discuss juggling the competing needs of stakeholders, how to\\n\\nhandle the issues and problems with stakeholders, and finally how to balance project con- straints against stakeholder needs.\\n\\nCompeting Needs\\n\\nStakeholders come from all areas of the organization and include your customer as well. Because stakeholders do not all work in the same areas, they have competing needs and interests. One stakeholder’s concern on a typical IT project might take the form of system security issues, while another stakeholder is concerned about ease of use. As the project manager, you will have situa- tions in which stakeholder needs compete with each other, and you’ll have to decide between them and set priorities. Sometimes you’ll be able to accommodate their needs, and sometimes you’ll have to choose. You need to examine the needs against the project objectives and then use your negotiation and communication skills to convince the stakeholders of priorities.\\n\\nIndividual stakeholders may or may not have good working relationships with other stake- holders. Because of this, office politics will come into play. I advise you to stay away from the politics game but get to know your stakeholders. You’ll need to understand their business pro- cesses and needs in order to make decisions about stakeholder requirements.\\n\\nDealing with Issues and Problems\\n\\nProblems will occur on your project—it’s part of the process. We’ve talked throughout this book about how to deal with problems and risks and how to use conflict resolution techniques in handling problems. Balancing stakeholder needs comes into play here also.\\n\\nYou’ll have to determine alternatives that will meet the key requirements of the project with- out jeopardizing the competing needs of stakeholders. Once you’re into the Executing processes of the project and beyond, redefining scope becomes less and less of an option. So your respon- sibility is to resolve issues and determine alternative solutions to problems as they occur without changing the original objectives of the project. Enlist the help of your project team members and stakeholders during these times. Use some of the techniques we talked about in Chapter 5, “Risk Planning,” like brainstorming and the Delphi technique, to find solutions.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 477  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nBalancing Stakeholders’ Interests\\n\\n477\\n\\nYou may also have difficulty trying to make stakeholders understand your decision or the technical nature of a problem. Again, this is where communication skills help you immensely. Take the case of a technical problem that’s cropped up on your project. You should not expect your stakeholder to understand the technical aspects of rocket science if they work in the finance department, for example. It’s up to you to keep the explanation at a level they can understand without loading them down with technical jargon and specifications. Keep your explanations simple, yet don’t skip important details they’ll need to make decisions.\\n\\nBalancing Constraints\\n\\nYour toughest issues will almost always center on the triple constraints: time, cost, and quality. Because of the very nature of the constraints, one of these is the primary driver and one is the least important. Keep a close eye on stakeholders who want to switch the priority of the con- straints for their own purposes. Let’s say the project sponsor already told you that time is the primary constraint. Another stakeholder tells you that a requirement of the project is being overlooked and quality is suffering. Be careful that the stakeholder isn’t trying to divert the pri- mary constraint from time to quality to suit their own objectives.\\n\\nThe Geographic Information System\\n\\nRyan Loveland is a project manager for a multinational company. He’s working on a complex software project that involves rewriting the organization’s mainframe accounting system to become a browser-based system running on thin-client architecture. A major problem with the existing system occurs when new accounts are entered into the system or account information changes. The accounts are tied to geographic areas, which are assigned to individual sales asso- ciates. Sales commissions are paid based on where the account resides. To date, the process of determining which territory an account belongs to has been done manually by looking at a map.\\n\\nThe project sponsor, Victor, requested a geographic information system (GIS) as part of the requirements of this project. The hope is that errors will be eliminated and commissions will get processed correctly. The sponsor is hoping that Ryan’s internal team can write the GIS sys- tem that will tie to the accounting system. Let’s drop in on Ryan and Victor’s conversation.\\n\\n“I just don’t understand,” Victor says. “I can go onto that Internet site and plug in an address and get directions and a map detailing those directions from my house to anywhere in the country. It seems easy enough to me. Why can’t your team write code like that?”\\n\\n“It isn’t that we can’t write a program to do that. But there are several issues surrounding this request that I’d like to explain to you. I’d like you to understand why I’m asking to purchase a software product from an external vendor that will take care of these functions for us.”\\n\\n“Let’s hear it,” Victor says.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 478  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n478\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2)\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\n“One of the first problems is that our sales force is multinational. It would take us months just to obtain address information to populate the program. The second issue is that our sales dis- tricts are not divided by any known boundaries. Most GIS systems work off of latitude and lon- gitude or geographic boundaries like county borders or zip code boundaries.”\\n\\nVictor interrupts, “Well, here’s what we do. You give me a set of maps and I’ll hand-draw in the sales districts and then you can scan it into the system.”\\n\\n“Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. Our sales district boundaries are not consistent with known boundaries, and our existing address database is not standardized. For example, some addresses use the word All of the addresses need to be stan- dardized, and then we have to figure out which addresses belong to which territory.\\n\\nspelled out; some use the abbreviation\\n\\nStreet\\n\\nSt.\\n\\n“This process could take a great deal of time. There are vendors that specialize in GIS systems that could have us operational in a matter of weeks. I’ve already checked on a couple of the top vendors, and there aren’t any problems interfacing with our new system. The time we’d save in the long run far outweighs the cost associated with purchasing this system from a vendor. And one last point: If I were to build this system internally, I’d have to take our top program- ming team off of existing project priorities to put them on this. GIS systems are extremely com- plicated. We’re talking several months—if not a year or more delay—to get our programmers up to speed on GIS techniques and then write the programs.”\\n\\nVictor says, “If we’re talking about a major delay in the schedule as you say, we can at least look at what these vendors have to offer. It’s important that this system is accurate as well, and I think I hear you saying, ‘Why reinvent the wheel.’ Let’s have a look at the costs.”\\n\\nRespecting Differences in Diverse Cultures\\n\\nYou have probably taken diversity or cultural differences training classes sometime during your career. Most organizations today require diversity training for all employees and contractors. Project managers who work on contract may find themselves taking these classes multiple times, as companies want to ensure that every employee and contractor has taken their own ver- sion of the class.\\n\\nI won’t attempt to repeat diversity training here, but I will point out some of the things you should know about working in other countries and about working with people who have back- grounds and belief systems that are different than yours. I’ll also touch on training as a diversity awareness tool and discuss how people’s perceptions influence their reactions.\\n\\nGlobal Competition\\n\\nMore and more companies compete in the global marketplace. As a result, project managers with multinational experience are increasingly in demand. This requires a heightened awareness of cultural influences and customary practices of the country where you’re temporarily residing.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 479  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nRespecting Differences in Diverse Cultures\\n\\n479\\n\\nIf you are used to working in the U.S., for example, you know that our culture tends to value\\n\\naccomplishments and individualism. We tend to be informal and call each other by our first names, even if we’ve just met. Europeans tend to be more formal, using surnames instead of first names in a business setting, even when they know each other well. Their communication style is more formal than in the U.S., and while they tend to value individualism, they also value his- tory, hierarchy, and loyalty. The Japanese, on the other hand, tend to communicate indirectly and consider themselves part of a group, not as individuals. The Japanese value hard work and success, as most of us do.\\n\\nOne thing I’ve witnessed when working in foreign countries is U.S. citizens who try to force\\n\\ntheir own culture or customs on those with whom they’re visiting or working. That isn’t rec- ommended, and it generally offends those you’re trying to impress. Don’t expect others to con- form to your way of doing things, especially when you’re in their country. You know the saying “When in Rome, do as the Romans do”? While you may not want to take that literally, the intent is good. For example, a quick kiss on both cheeks is a customary greeting in many coun- tries. If that is the case and it’s how you’re greeted, respond with the same.\\n\\nCulture Shock\\n\\nWorking in a foreign country can bring about an experience called spent years acting certain ways and expecting normal, everyday events to follow a specific course of action, you might find yourself disoriented when things don’t go as you expected. This is known as culture shock.\\n\\nWhen you’ve\\n\\nculture shock.\\n\\nOne of the ways you can avoid this is to read about the country you’re going to work in before getting there. The Internet is a great resource for information like this. Your local library is another place to research customs and acceptable practices in foreign countries.\\n\\nWhen in doubt about a custom or what you should do in a given situation, ask your hosts or a trusted contact from the company you’ll be working with to help you out. People are people all over the world, and they love to talk about themselves and their culture. They’re also gen- erally helpful, and they will respect you more for asking what’s expected rather than acting as though you know what to do when you clearly do not.\\n\\nRespecting Your Neighbors\\n\\nAmericans tend to run their lives at high speed and get right down to business when working with vendors or customers. It isn’t unusual for a business person to board a plane in the morn- ing, show up at the client site and take care of business, and hop another flight to the next client site that night.\\n\\nYou’ll find that this is not that common in many other countries. People in other countries\\n\\nwill expect you to take time to get to know them first, building an atmosphere of trust and respect. Some cultures build relationships first and then proceed to business. And don’t expect to do that relationship building in a few hours. It could take several days, depending on the cul- ture. They may even want you to meet their family and spend time getting to know them. Resist the urge to get right down to business if that’s not customary in the culture because you’ll likely spoil the deal or damage relationships past the point of repair.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 480  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n480\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2)\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\nSpend time building relationships with others. Once an atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation is established, all aspects of project planning and management—including negotiating and problem solving—are much easier to navigate.\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nSometimes you may find yourself working with teams of people from different countries or cul- tures. Some team members might be from one country and some from another. The best way to ensure that cultural or ethical differences do not hinder your project is to provide training for all team members.\\n\\nTeam-building activities are ways to build mutual trust and respect and bond team members with differing backgrounds. Choose activities that are nonoffensive and ones in which everyone can participate.\\n\\nDiversity training makes people aware of differences between cultures and ethnic groups, and it helps them to gain respect and trust for those on their team. Provide training regarding the project objectives and the company culture as well.\\n\\nProject objectives are why you are all together in the first place. Project objec- tives cut across cultural boundaries and keep everyone focused on the project and tasks at hand.\\n\\nPerceiving Experiences\\n\\nAll of us see the world through our own experiences. Your experiences are not someone else’s experiences, and therefore what you perceive about a situation might be very different from what others believe. Keep this in mind when it appears that a misunderstanding has occurred or that someone you’re working with didn’t respond as you expected. This is especially true when you’re working with someone from another country. Always give others the benefit of the doubt and ask for clarification if you think there is a problem. Put your feelings in check temporarily and remember that what you think the other person means is not necessarily as it appears.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 481  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nRespecting Differences in Diverse Cultures\\n\\n481\\n\\nProject Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store\\n\\nJill Overstreet thought you did such a great job of managing this project that she’s offered to buy you lunch at one of those upscale, white tablecloth–type French restaurants. The iced teas have just been delivered, and you and Jill are chatting about business.\\n\\n“I’m impressed with your project management skills. This store opening was the best on record. And you really kept Dirk in line—I admire that. He can be headstrong, but you had a way of convincing him what needed doing and then sticking to it.”\\n\\n“Thanks,” you reply. “I’ve got a few years of project management experience, so many of those lessons learned on previous projects helped me out with this project. I enjoy project manage- ment and read books and articles on the subject whenever I get the chance. It’s nice when you can learn from others’ mistakes and avoid making them yourself.”\\n\\nJill takes a long drink of tea. She glances at you over the top of her glass and pauses before set- ting it down. The look on her face implies she’s sizing you up and deciding whether to tell you what’s on her mind.\\n\\n“You know,” Jill starts, “we almost didn’t hire anyone for your position. Dirk wanted to do away with the project management role altogether. He had a real distaste for project manage- ment after our last project.”\\n\\n“Why is that?”\\n\\nJill explains, “The last project manager got involved in a conflict of interest situation. She was working on a project that involved updating and remodeling all the existing stores. Things like new fixtures, signs, shelving, display cases, and such were up for bid. And it was a very sizable bid. Not only did she accept an all-expenses-paid weekend visit to a resort town from one of the vendors bidding on the contract, she also revealed company secrets to them, some of which leaked to our competitors.”\\n\\nYour mouth drops open. “I can’t believe she would accept gifts like that from a vendor. And revealing company secrets is almost worse. Conflict of interest situations and not protecting intellectual property violate the code of professional conduct that certified PMPs agree to adhere to. I can understand why Dirk didn’t want to hire another project manager. Behavior like that makes all project managers look bad.”\\n\\n“I’m glad you kept things above board and won Dirk back over. The project management role is important to Kitchen Heaven, and I know your skills in this discipline are what made this project such a success.”\\n\\n3601.book  Page 482  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n482\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2)\\n\\nProfessional Responsibility\\n\\n“Jill, not only would I never compromise my own integrity through a conflict of interest situa- tion, I would report the situation and the vendor to the project sponsor and to PMI as an ethics violation. It’s better to be honest and let the project sponsor or key stakeholders know what’s happening than to hide the situation or, even worse, compromise your own integrity by getting involved in it in the first place. You have my word that I’ll keep business interests above my own personal interests. I’ll report anything that even looks like it would call my actions into question just to keep things honest and out in the open.”\\n\\n“That’s good to hear,” Jill replies. “Congratulations on your new assignment. Dirk and I were discussing the new Home Chef Pro project yesterday. We’re venturing into new territory with this project, and I’m confident you’ll do an excellent job heading it up. Dirk made a good choice.”\\n\\nProject Case Study Checklist\\n\\nEnsuring personal and professional integrity\\n\\nAdhering to the PMP Code of Professional Conduct\\n\\nNot placing personal gain above business needs\\n\\nAvoiding conflict of interest situations\\n\\nTruthfully reporting questionable situations and maintaining honesty\\n\\nProtecting intellectual property\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nProject Management Professionals are responsible for reporting truthful information about their PMP status and project management experience to prospective customers, clients, and employers and to PMI. As a project manager, you’re responsible for the integrity of the project management process and the product. In all situations, you are responsible for your own per- sonal integrity.\\n\\nPersonal integrity means adhering to an ethical standard. As a PMP, you’ll be required to\\n\\nadhere to the avoiding putting your own personal gain above the project objectives.\\n\\nPMP Code of Professional Conduct\\n\\nestablished by PMI. Part of this code involves\\n\\nAs a professional, you should strive to maintain honesty in project reporting. You’re\\n\\nrequired to abide by laws, rules, and regulations regarding your industry and project manage- ment practices. You should also report any instances that might appear to be a conflict of inter- est. It’s always better to inform others of an apparent conflict than to have it discovered by others and have your methods called into question after the fact.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 483  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\n483\\n\\nYou will very likely come across confidential information or intellectual property during your project management experiences. Respect the use of this information and always verify who may have permission to access the information and when disclosures are required.\\n\\nStakeholders have competing needs and business issues and as such will sometimes cause conflict on your project. You will be required to balance the needs and interests of the stake- holders with the project objectives.\\n\\nMany project managers today are working in a global environment. It’s important to respect and understand the cultural differences that exist and not try to impose your cultural beliefs on others. Culture shock is an experience that occurs when you find yourself in a different cultural environment than you’re familiar with. Training is a good way to provide project team members with relationship management techniques regarding cultural and ethnic differences.\\n\\nExam Essentials\\n\\nBe able to define integrity.\\n\\nIntegrity means adhering to an ethical standard.\\n\\nBe able to name the ethical standard PMPs are required to adhere to. The ethical standard PMPs are required to adhere to is described in the PMP Code of Professional Conduct.\\n\\nDescribe the areas in which PMPs must apply professional knowledge. PMPs must apply professional knowledge in the areas of project management practices, industry practices, and technical areas.\\n\\nKnow the key activity that ensures customer satisfaction. The key activity that ensures cus- tomer satisfaction is documenting project requirements.\\n\\nDefine how multinational project managers must manage relationships. Multinational project managers manage relationships by building relationships based on mutual trust and acceptance and recognizing and respecting diverse cultures and ethnic beliefs.\\n\\nKey Terms\\n\\nYou’ve learned a lot of new key words in this chapter.

Give the information to your friend. You know their character and can trust that they won’t\\n\\ntell anyone.\\n\\nB. Tell your friend that after all this time, they should know you better than to think you’d put your personal integrity on the line or compromise your job due to a conflict of interest. Decline to give them the information.\\n\\nC. Tell your friend you’ll give them the information if they’ll promise not to tell anyone and if they’ll agree to help you out with some materials on your basement-refinishing project.\\n\\nD. Give the information to your friend and inform the project sponsor so that the information\\n\\ncan be shared with the other bidders as well.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 490  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n490\\n\\nChapter 12 (cid:2) Professional Responsibility\\n\\nAnswers to Review Questions\\n\\n1. A. You are not responsible for the personal integrity of others, but as project manager you do\\n\\nhave influence over others, such as your project team members.\\n\\n2. C. Integrity means you’ll honestly report project outcomes and status. Your personal gain\\n\\nshould not be placed above the satisfaction of the customer.\\n\\n3. A. Diversity training is used to help you manage project teams that are made up of people from other countries or cultures. Integrity is accomplished by following an ethical code and applying project management practices.\\n\\n4. D. The best answer to this problem is to develop alternative solutions to address design error. Reducing technical requirements might be an alternative solution, but it’s not one you’d imple- ment without looking at all the alternatives. Ignoring the error and going forward with produc- tion will result in an unsatisfactory product for the customer.\\n\\n5. A. A luncheon date could be considered a conflict of interest prior to awarding a contract to a vendor. Consider what a competitor of this vendor would think if they spotted you having lunch together.\\n\\n6. B. The best response to this situation is to thank the vendor and decline based on the fact that this could be considered personal gain on your part. Answer D may seem correct, but remember, you’re not responsible for the integrity of others. And it’s often common business practice for vendors to offer gifts to potential customers.\\n\\n7. D. The best response in this case is to accept the gift because it would cause great offense to the other party if you were to decline. Report the gift and the circumstances as soon as possible to the appropriate parties at your company.\\n\\n8. D. This is a conflict of interest situation and should be reported as a violation of the PMP Code\\n\\nof Professional Conduct.\\n\\n9. A. Documenting the requirements is one of the key things you can do to ensure customer satis-\\n\\nfaction. The requirements describe what the customer is looking for, and the final product is compared against them to determine if all of the requirements were met.\\n\\n10. C. Stakeholder requirements are needed to determine if the project is successful and are not a\\n\\npart of the professional code.\\n\\n11. B. The situation presented here requires you to put the interest of the company and the confi- dentiality of the data above your own personal interests or those of your stakeholders. Option D is not the most correct response because it says you believe the information is public. This implies you haven’t verified whether the data is private or public. Until you know, treat the data as confidential. In this case, the information is confidential and should be shared only with those who have a valid reason for using it.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 491  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\nAnswers to Review Questions\\n\\n491\\n\\n12. C. As project manager, it’s your responsibility to make sure the people you will be sharing data with have the proper permissions to see the data; this question indicated that you did that. In this case, option D is not correct because it implies that you did not verify ahead of time that the stakeholder had the proper level of approvals to use the data.\\n\\n13. A. Applying professional knowledge involves staying abreast of project management practices,\\n\\nindustry trends, and new technology and honestly reporting your experiences.\\n\\n14. D. Culture shock is the disoriented feeling that people may experience when working in a for-\\n\\neign country.\\n\\n15. D. The most appropriate response is to deny the request. Software is considered intellectual\\n\\nproperty and should not be used for personal gain or given to others without prior consent from the organization. This question states that the release of the beta software is handled through the marketing department, so you should not give your friend a copy of the software outside of this process.\\n\\n16. A. The most correct response is to first provide training to your team members to teach them how to respect and work with others from different cultures. Collocation may not be possible when you’re working with team members from two different countries. Team-building exercises are a good idea as well but are not your first course of action.\\n\\n17. B. Your first meeting with foreign partners should be spent getting to know them on a personal\\n\\nbasis. Many cultures like to spend time building relationships first and then talking business. Since you’ve been invited to dinner upon your arrival and the dinner includes the spouses of your prospective partners, chances are they want to spend some time getting to know you personally first. Discussion of the company’s rules, standards, and operating policies should occur at the second or third meeting.\\n\\n18. C. The most appropriate response is to inform the potential partners that an ingredient exists in the sauce that is not acceptable and determine to come up with a solution to the problem. As a professional, you’re required to be honest in your reporting. Not telling them, or stalling by promising an investigation, is not an honest response.\\n\\n19. A. The most appropriate response is to decline to participate due to a conflict of interest.\\n\\n20. B. This situation is clearly a conflict of interest and should be avoided. Decline to provide your\\n\\nfriend this information.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 492  Tuesday, July 12, 2005  11:17 PM\\n\\n3601.book  Page 493  Thursday, July 14, 2005  3:53 PM\\n\\nGlossary\\n\\n3601.book  Page 494  Thursday, July 14, 2005  3:53 PM\\n\\n494\\n\\nGlossary\\n\\nNumbers\\n\\n360-degree reviews are a form of project performance appraisal (a tool\\n\\n360-degree review and technique of the Manage Project process) that solicit feedback from everyone the team member interacts with, including the stakeholders, customers, project manager, peers, subor- dinates, and others.\\n\\nA\\n\\nacceptance Acceptance is a strategy for threats or opportunities and is a tool and technique of the Risk Response Planning process.

This is a temporary solution.\\n\\nsoft logic See discretionary dependencies.\\n\\nstakeholder A person or organization who has a vested interest in the project and stands to gain or lose something as a result of the project.\\n\\nstarvation A type of project ending where financial or human resources are cut off from the project.\\n\\nstatistical sampling Taking a sample number of parts from the whole population and exam- ining them to determine if they fall within the variances outlined by the quality control plan. Sta- tistical sampling is a tool and technique of the Perform Quality Control process.\\n\\nstatus review meetings Status meetings are a tool and technique of the Project Plan Execu- tion process. The purpose of status meetings is to provide updated information regarding the progress of the project. They are not show-and-tell meetings.\\n\\nsteering committee A group of high-level managers or executives in the organization who manage project prioritization and various project decisions. The steering committee typically represents functional areas or departments within the organization.\\n\\nsuccessor activities Activities that follow predecessor activities.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 519  Thursday, July 14, 2005  3:53 PM\\n\\nGlossary\\n\\n519\\n\\nT\\n\\ntailoring Determining which processes and process groups should be performed for the project. The project manager and project team should take into consideration the size and com- plexity of the project and the various inputs and outputs of each of the processes when deter- mining which ones to perform. It’s generally accepted that performing all five process groups is good practice for any project.\\n\\nteam building Team building activities are a tool and technique of the Develop Project Team process. They involve getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most efficient and effective manner possible.\\n\\ntechnical performance measurements These measurements are usually determined during trend analysis (which is used with the run chart tool and technique of the Perform Quality Con- trol process) to compare the technical accomplishments of project milestones completed to the technical milestones defined in the project Planning processes.\\n\\nTheory X A motivational management theory that proposes that most people do not like work and will try to steer clear of it. It postulates that people have little to no ambition, need constant supervision, and won’t actually perform the duties of their job unless threatened.\\n\\nTheory Y A motivational management theory that proposes that people are interested in per- forming their best given the right motivation and proper expectations.\\n\\nthree-point estimates Three-point estimates are a tool and technique of the Activity Dura- tion Estimating process used to determine activity estimates. The three estimates are the most likely estimate, an optimistic estimate, and a pessimistic estimate.\\n\\ntime and materials (T&M) contract A type of contract that is a cross between the fixed price contract and the cost reimbursable contract. Preset unit rates are agreed to at contract signing, but costs are charged to the buyer as they’re incurred.\\n\\ntolerable results Quality measurements that fall within a specified range. Tolerable results are a concern of the Perform Quality Control process. These are also known as tolerances.\\n\\ntop-down estimating See analogous estimating.\\n\\ntornado diagram This is a diagramming method for sensitivity analysis data. The variables with the greatest effect on the project are displayed as horizontal bars at the top of the graph and decrease in impact as they progress down through the graph. This gives a quick overview of how much the project can be affected by uncertainty in the various elements and which risks have the greatest impact on the project.\\n\\ntotal float The amount of time the earliest start of a task can be delayed without delaying the ending of the project.\\n\\ntraining A tool and technique of the Develop Project Team process that improves the compe- tencies of the project team members.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 520  Thursday, July 14, 2005  3:53 PM\\n\\n520\\n\\nGlossary\\n\\ntransfer Transference is a strategy for negative risks or threats, which is a tool and technique of the Risk Response Planning process. This strategy transfers the consequences of a risk to a third party. Insurance is an example of transference.\\n\\ntriggers Risk symptoms that imply a risk event is about to occur.\\n\\nV\\n\\nvariance at completion (VAC) An earned value analysis technique that calculates the differ- ence between the budget at completion (BAC) and the estimate at completion (EAC). VAC = BAC – EAC\\n\\nvirtual teams Virtual teams are teams that don’t necessarily work in the same location but all share the goals of the project and have a role on the project. This type of team allows the inclu- sion of resources from different geographic locations, those who work different hours or shifts from the other team members, those with mobility limitations, and so on.\\n\\nW\\n\\nweighted scoring model See weighting system.\\n\\nweighting system A way to rank and score vendor proposals or project proposals. Weighting systems assign numerical weights to evaluation criteria and then multiply this by the weight of each criteria factor to come up with total scores for each project or vendor. These systems keep personal biases to a minimum. Weighting systems are a tool and technique of the Selecting Sellers process and a project selection method, which is a tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process.\\n\\nwithdrawal This conflict resolution technique occurs when one of the parties gets up and leaves and refuses to discuss the conflict. This never results in resolution.\\n\\nwork authorization systems Work authorization systems clarify and initiate the work of each work package or activity. This is a formal procedure that authorizes work to begin in the correct sequence and at the right time. Work authorization systems are usually written proce- dures defined by the organization. These are used in the Executing processes of the project.\\n\\nwork performance information Work performance information is an input to the Contract Administration process. Work performance information is used to monitor work results and examine the vendor’s deliverables and compares their work results against the project manage- ment plan. It also makes certain activities are performed correctly and in sequence.\\n\\nworkaround An unplanned response to a risk event that was unknown and unidentified or an unplanned response to a risk that was previously accepted. Workaround plans are an element of the Risk Monitoring and Control process.\\n\\n3601.book  Page 521  Thursday, July 14, 2005  3:53 PM\\n\\nIndex\\n\\nNote to the reader: Throughout this index boldfaced page numbers indicate primary discussions of a topic.

However, keep in mind they are only one aspect of project selec- tion in the real world. The individual opinion, and power, of selection committee members also plays a part in the projects the organization chooses to perform. Don’t underestimate the importance of the authority, political standing, and individual aspirations of selection committee members. Those committee members who happen to carry a lot of weight in company circles, so to speak, are likely to get their projects approved just on the fact that they are who they are. This is sometimes how project selection works in my organization.

In other words, selection methods measure the value of what the product or ser- vice of the project will produce and how it will benefit the organization.

The project selection methods tool and technique calculates measurable differences between projects and determines the tangible benefits to the company of choosing or not choosing the project.\\n\\nProject selection methods will vary depending on the company, the people serving on the selection committee, the criteria used, and the project. Sometimes selection methods will be purely financial, sometimes purely marketing, and sometimes they’ll be based on public percep- tion or political perception. In most cases, the decision is based on a combination of all of these and more.\\n\\nMost organizations have a formal, or at least semiformal, process for selecting and prior- itizing projects. In my organization, a steering committee is responsible for project review, is a group of folks comprising senior man- selection, and prioritization. A agers and sometimes midlevel managers who represent each of the functional areas in the organization.\\n\\nsteering committee\\n\\nHere’s how our process works: The steering committee requests project ideas from the business staff prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. These project ideas are submitted in writing and contain a high-level overview of the project goals, a description of the deliver- ables, the business justification for the project, a desired implementation date, what the organization stands to gain from implementing the project, a list of the functional business areas affected by the project, and if applicable, a cost-benefit analysis (we’ll talk about that in a bit).\\n\\nA meeting is called to review the projects and a determination is made on each project as to whether it will be included on the upcoming list of projects for the new year. Once the no-go projects have been weeded out, the remaining projects are prioritized according to their importance and benefit to the organization. The projects are documented on an official project list, and progress is reported on the active projects at the regular monthly steering committee meetings.\\n\\nIn theory, it’s a great idea. In practice, it works only moderately well. Priorities can and do change throughout the year. New projects come up that weren’t originally submitted during the call for projects and they must be added to the list. Reprioritization begins anew, and resource alignment and assignments are shuffled. But again, we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Just be aware that organizations usually have a process to recognize and screen project requests, accept or reject those requests based on some selection criteria, and prioritize the projects based on some criteria.', metadata={'source': '/content/Project Mgt.pdf'}),\n",
